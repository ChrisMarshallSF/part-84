It's boozy charm and kitchen-sink production has won him fans from Yellowknife toToyko. In August 2000, The National Post selected &quot;Hangover Honeymoon&quot; as one of the 133 &quot;Essential Canadian CDs&quot; of all time. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/02/kevin-quain/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/02/kevin-quain/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d40707a9f35c4b811a9a9f726ff620403a33fe0f","amp;dn":"Kevin+Quain...Hangover+Honeymoon%281999%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d40707a9f35c4b811a9a9f726ff620403a33fe0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,7,7,169,243,92,75,129,26,154,159,114,111,246,32,64,58,51,254,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
