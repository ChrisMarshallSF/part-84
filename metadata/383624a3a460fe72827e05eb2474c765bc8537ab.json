Filippenko received a Bachelor of Arts in physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1979 and a Ph.D. in astronomy from the California Institute of Technology in 1984. His research focuses on supernovae and active galaxies at optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared wavelengths.\n\n\nResearch\n\nFilippenko was a member of the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-z Supernova Search Team that used observations of extragalactic supernovae to discover the accelerating universe. This universal acceleration implies the existence of dark energy and was voted the top science breakthrough of 1998 by Science magazine.\n\nFilippenko developed and runs the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), a fully robotic telescope which conducts the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS), the most successful nearby supernova search. He is also a member of the Nuker Team which uses the Hubble space telescope to examine supermassive black holes and determined the relationship between a galaxys central black holes mass and velocity dispersion. The Thompson-Reuters incites index ranked Filippenko as the most cited researcher in space science for the ten year period between 1996 and 2006.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383624a3a460fe72827e05eb2474c765bc8537ab","amp;dn":"Alex+Fillipenko+Selected+Non+TTC+Talks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383624a3a460fe72827e05eb2474c765bc8537ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,54,36,163,164,96,254,114,130,126,5,235,36,116,199,101,188,133,55,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
