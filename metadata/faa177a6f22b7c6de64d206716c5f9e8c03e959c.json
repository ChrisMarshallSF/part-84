Although Zuku\nwould probably want to be known for its heavier\nsongs, the lighter-by-comparison \\&quot;The Wave Washes\nAway\\&quot; is a smash hit with its altogether-now\npossibility they won\\'t stop calling for\nyou/foryou/for you/ for you, while \\&quot;Steelveins\\&quot; is a\ncountry bluegrass clap-along that could be stepped\nup onstage into wild hootenanny.\n\nLead singer/guitarist Brandon Kennedy devised Zuku\nin 2003, working on the sound while he was still in\nmetal outfit Goat Horn. Flash forward to the fall of\n2006, and he and Mike Conroy (guitar, vocals),\nJordan Beard (guitar, vocals) and Chris Chartrand\n(drums) joined him at Toronto\\'s Hallam Studios for\ntwo months to record the EP. Kennedy co-produced\nalongside Uncut\\'s Jon Drew (Toyko Police Club,\nMagneta Lane). There has been a change to the Zuku\nline-up since, hence the incognito press photo, but\nnow Matt Felske has stepped in to replace Conroy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa177a6f22b7c6de64d206716c5f9e8c03e959c","amp;dn":"Zuku-Here_With_You-%28EP%29-2007-uF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa177a6f22b7c6de64d206716c5f9e8c03e959c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,161,119,166,242,43,124,109,230,77,32,103,22,197,249,232,192,62,149,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
