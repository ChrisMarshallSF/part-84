Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.\n\n   19 &quot;After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'\n\n   21 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   22 &quot;The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'\n\n   23 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   24 &quot;Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'\n\n   26 &quot;His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.\n\n   28 &quot;'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nI am so tired of hearing this nonsense go back and forth, over and over again...\n\n&quot;This is better...

It is the latest game in the Civilization series.\n\nIn Civilization V, the player leads a civilization from prehistoric times into the future on a procedurally-generated map, achieving one of a number of different victory conditions through research, diplomacy, expansion, economic development, government and military conquest. The game is based on an entirely new game engine with hexagonal tiles instead of the square tiles of earlier games in the series. Many elements from Civilization IV and its expansion packs have been removed or changed, such as religion and espionage. The combat system has been overhauled, removing stacking of military units and enabling cities to defend themselves by firing directly on nearby enemies. In addition, the maps contain computer-controlled city-states as non-player characters that are available for trade, diplomacy and conquest. A civilization's borders also expand one tile at a time, favoring more productive tiles, and roads now have a maintenance cost, making them much less common.\n\nThe game features community, modding and multiplayer elements.\n\n\nContents\n________\n\n\n1 Gameplay \n\n  -  1.1 Computer controlled states\n\n  -  1.2 Cities\n\n  -  1.3 Units and combat\n\n  -  1.4 Research\n\n  -  1.5 City-states\n\n  -  1.6 Social policies\n\n  -  1.7 Victory conditions\n\n  -  1.8 Civilizations and leaders\n\n  -  1.9 Downloadable content\n\n2 Release\n\n3 Reception\n\n\n\nGameplay\n________\n________\n\n\nCivilization V is a turn-based strategy game, where each player represents the leader of a certain nation or ethnic group (&quot;civilization&quot;) and must guide its growth over the course of thousands of years. It starts with the founding of a small primitive settlement and ends after achieving one of the victory conditionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or surviving until the number of game turns end, at which point the highest-scoring civilization, based on several factors, is declared the winner. During their turn, the player must manage units representing civilian and military forces: directing units to explore the world, found new cities, go into battle to take over other civilizations, control production in their cities to produce new units, improve land, handle diplomacy with other civilizations in the game, and finally direct the civilization's growth in technology, culture, food supply, and economics. Victory conditions can include taking over the entire world by force, convincing the other civilizations through diplomacy to acknowledge you as a leader, building the &quot;Utopia Project&quot; wonder by adopting social policies or winning the space race to build a colony ship to reach a nearby planet.\n\n\nComputer controlled states\n__________________________\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) in Civilization V is designed to operate on four levels: the tactical AI controls individual units; the operational AI oversees the entire war front; the strategic AI manages the entire empire; and the grand strategic AI sets long-term goals and determines how to win the game. The four levels of AI complement each other to allow for complex and flexible AI behaviors.\n\nEach of the AI-controlled leaders has a unique personality, determined by a combination of 'flavors' on a ten-point scale; however, the values may differ slightly in each game. There are 25 flavors, grouped into categories including growth, expansion, wide strategy, military preferences, recon, naval recon, naval growth, and development preferences.\n\n\nCities\n______\n\nAs in previous versions, cities remain the central pillar of Civilization gameplay. A city can be founded on a desired location by a settler unit, and the city will grow in population, produce units and buildings, and generate research and wealth. The city will also develop culturally and expand its borders one tile at a time, which is critical in claiming territory and resources. The expansion process is automated and directed towards the city's needs, but it can be accelerated with gold. Cities can spread up to three tiles outwards, instead of two.\n\nCity warfare has been revamped. Whereas cities in previous versions of Civ relied entirely on garrisoned units for defense, cities in Civ 5 now defend themselves, and can attack invading units with a ranged attack expanding two tiles outward. Cities have hitpoints that, if taken down to zero will signal the city's defeat to invading forces. Hitpoints can be increased by garrisoning a unit in the city or building defensive structures. Captured cities can be annexed, razed, or transformed into puppet states, each option having distinct advantages and disadvantages; for example, puppet states will provide resources and have lower unhappiness, but cannot be directly controlled.\n\n\nUnits and combat\n________________\n\nIn this iteration of the series, tactical gameplay will be encouraged over numbers, with the introduction of new gameplay mechanisms. Most significantly, the square grid of the world map has been removed in favor of a hexagonal grid, a feature inspired by the 1994 game Panzer General, according to lead designer Jon Shafer. In addition, each hexagonal tile, including city tiles, can accommodate only one military unit at a time, forcing armies to spread out over large areas instead of piling onto a single tile. This has the effect of moving most large battles outside of the cities, and forces increased realism on sieges, which are now most effective when surrounding the city tile. Also, increased movement points, simpler transportation over water, ranged attacks, and swapping of adjacent units allows for more versatile maneuvering of units. There is also a balance between ranged and melee units. Early ranged units can attack melee units without retribution, but melee units will outright destroy ranged units.\n\nUnits take longer to produce than in previous games from the series, making them more valuable. As they defeat enemy units, units may be either promoted for bonuses or forgo their promotion to be completely healed. Another departure from previous games is that units are no longer always destroyed if defeated in combat.\n\nSpecial &quot;Great Person&quot; units are still present in the game, providing special bonuses to the civilization that births them, with each named after a historic figure such as Albert Einstein or Leonardo da Vinci. Great people come in several varieties, and can be consumed to produce one of 3 effects; start a golden age, build a unique terrain improvement, or perform a unique special ability. For example; a Great General can create a 'Citadel' (an improved fort with the ability to inflict damage on nearby enemy units), or increase the combat strength of nearby friendly units (this is the only ability that that does not require the consumption of the unit). Capturing a Great Person results in them turning into a normal worker, losing all of their special abilities, the same is true for Settlers (a game mechanic in place since Civilization IV).\n\n\nResearch\n________\n\nTechnology trading has been removed in favor of joint technological ventures. Two civilizations at peace can form a research pact, which for an initial investment of gold will provide both with a random unknown technology after a set number of turns as long as they remain at peace. However, it is possible for a civilization to sign a research agreement for the sole purpose of getting an enemy to spend money which could be used for other purposes; AI civilizations are programmed to sometimes use this tactic before declaring war. After the player discovers a new technology, a quote related to the technology is read by British actor Morgan Sheppard.\n\n\nCity-states\n___________\n\nCity-states, a new feature to the series, are minor civilizations that can be interacted with. Unlike major powers, however, they only expand in territory and never establish new cities. In addition to outright conquest, major civilizations have the option to befriend city states, via bribery or services, for bonuses such as resources and units; these bonuses increase as players advance to new eras. There are three types of city-states, each with different personalities and bonuses: maritime, cultured, and militaristic. A city state has the potential to play a prominent role in diplomacy among larger civilizations, as well as make specific requests and grant rewards.\n\n\nSocial policies\n_______________\n\nIn a change to the culture system, in Civilization V players have the ability to &quot;purchase&quot; social policies at the expense of earned culture. These social policies are made up of ten separate trees (some trees are mutually exclusive), and filling out five of the ten trees is a requirement to win a cultural victory. These policies replace the &quot;Civics&quot; government system of Civilization IV; the main difference is that the player had to switch out of old civics to adopt a new one, while social policies are cumulative bonuses. According to Jon Shafer, &quot;With the policies system, we wanted to keep the feel of mixing and matching to construct one's government that was part of Civ IV, but we also wanted to instill a sense of forward momentum. Rather than having to switch out of one policy to adopt another, you build upon the policies already unlocked. The thought process we want to promote is 'What cool new effect do I want?' rather than the feeling of needing to perform detailed analysis to determine if switching is a good idea.&quot;\n\n\nVictory conditions\n__________________\n\nAs in previous games, there are multiple ways to achieve victory in addition to military conquest. The player may focus on scientific research and become the first to assemble and launch a spaceship, winning a space race victory. Diplomatic victory requires support from other civilizations and city states in the United Nations. In the revamped culture system of Civilization V that consists of social policy &quot;trees&quot;, the cultural victory involves filling out five of the ten &quot;trees&quot; and completing the Utopia project (reminiscent of the Ascent to Transcendence secret project in Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri). World domination is of course an option, but the victory condition has been simplified compared to previous games in the series. Rather than completely destroying the other civilizations, the last player who controls their original capital wins by conquest. You can also win by having the highest score at the year 2050 AD.\n\n\nCivilizations and leaders\n_________________________\n\nThere are 18 civilizations available in the standard retail version of Civilization V. The player chooses a civilization and assumes the role of its leader, based on prominent historical figures. Each leader of a civilization has a unique unit, another unique unit or a unique building, and a special ability. The player is able to interact with the leaders of other civilizations via the diplomacy screen, which featuresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for the first time in the seriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½fully animated leaders that speak their native languages. For instance, Augustus Caesar speaks in his native Latin and Montezuma speaks in his native Nahuatl. According to ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°mile Khordoc, who voiced Augustus Caesar, the voices for the leaders were recorded in early 2009, approximately one and a half years before the release of the game.\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nCivilization    Leader               Capital               Unique Unit (1) \n____________    ______               _______               _______________\n      \nAmerica         Washington           Washington            Minuteman            \n\nArabia          Harun al-Rashid      Mecca                 Camel Archer        \n\nAztec           Montezuma            Tenochtitlan          Jaguar              \n\nChina           Wu Zetian            Beijing               Chu-Ko-Nu           \n\nEgypt           Ramesses II          Thebes                War Chariot         \n\nEngland         Elizabeth I          London                Longbowman          \n\nFrance          Napoleon             Paris                 Musketeer           \n\nGermany         Bismarck             Berlin                Landsknecht         \n\nGreece          Alexander            Athens                Hoplite             \n\nIndia           Gandhi               Delhi                 War Elephant        \n\nIroquois        Hiawatha             Onondaga              Mohawk Warrior      \n\nJapan           Oda Nobunaga         Kyoto                 Samurai             \n\nOttoman         Suleiman             Istanbul              Janissary           \n\nPersia          Darius               Persepolis            Immortal            \n\nRome            Augustus             Rome                  Legion              \n\nRussia          Catherine            Moscow                Cossack             \n\nSiam            Ramkhamhaeng         Sukhotai              Naresuan's Elephant \n\nSonghai         Askia                Gao                   Mandekalu Cavalry   \n\n\n\nCivilization    Unique Unit (2)      Unique Building       Unique Ability \n____________    _______________      _______________       ______________\n\nAmerica         B17                  None                  Manifest Destiny \n\nArabia          None                 Bazaar                Trade Caravans \n\nAztec           None                 Floating Garden       Sacrificial Captives \n\nChina           None                 Paper Maker           Art of War \n\nEgypt           None                 Burial Tomb           Monument Builders \n\nEngland         Ship of the Line     None                  Sun Never Sets \n\nFrance          Foreign Legion       None                  Ancien Regime \n\nGermany         Panzer               None                  Furor Teutonicus \n\nGreece          Companion Cavalry    None                  Hellenic League \n\nIndia           None                 Mughal Fort           Population Growth \n\nIroquois        None                 Longhouse             The Great Warpath \n\nJapan           Zero                 None                  Bushido \n\nOttoman         Sipahi               None                  Barbary Corsairs \n\nPersia          None                 Satrap's Court        Achaemenid Legacy \n\nRome            Ballista             None                  The Glory of Rome \n\nRussia          None                 Krepost               Siberian Riches \n\nSiam            None                 Wat                   Father Governs Children\n\nSonghai         None                 Mud Pyramid Mosque    River Warlord \n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nDownloadable content\n____________________\n\nBesides the 18 civilizations available in the standard retail version, additional civilizations will be available as downloadable content (DLC).

The Mac OS X incarnation saw release on November 23, 2010. In conjunction with its release, the State of Maryland, where Meier and Firaxis are based, named September 21, 2010 as &quot;Sid Meier's Civilization V Day&quot;, in part due to Meier's success and for him &quot;continuing a tradition of developing the talent and creativity of future generations&quot;.\n\nA special edition of Civilization V was also set for worldwide release on the same day as the standard edition. The package consists of a 176-page artbook, a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; DVD at Firaxis, 2-CD game soundtrack selections, and 5 metal figurines of in-game units, as well as the game itself.\n\nA demo became available on September 21, the same day as the North American full game release. It is distributed via Steam.\n\n\nReception\n_________\n\nCivilization V was met positively by critics, achieving a Metacritic score of 90/100 after 61 reviews. Gametrailers.com gave it 9.4 out of 10. G4TV gave it 5 out of 5, describing it as a &quot;fantastic turn-based strategy game... In many ways... the best representation of the series and certainly the most accessible for new and old players alike&quot;, adding that the &quot;diplomatic model is anemic&quot; and describing the AI as &quot;fairly average.&quot; IGN gave the game an &quot;Outstanding 9.0&quot;, saying &quot;This is the first Civilization for PC that is worth just about every personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time&quot;, but also criticizing the AI for being too aggressive and noting that players who played Civilization IV may miss the civics and religion features. Gamespot praised the game's addictiveness, claiming it to be &quot;yet another glistening example of turn-based bliss that will keep you up long past your bedtime&quot;.\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n                             Now, go save the World...\n\n                                 God, bless you...\n\n###################################################################################\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&lt;/a&gt;\n\n###################################################################################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc7a0a0cd5b86924131021230ef52f15d9e13c3","amp;dn":"Sid+Meier+-+Civilization+IV+%28Build+3.17%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc7a0a0cd5b86924131021230ef52f15d9e13c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,199,160,160,205,91,134,146,65,49,2,18,48,239,82,241,93,158,19,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
