While most rabid rap fans abandoned PE's revolution in the mid-1990s--once the group stopped utilizing the noisy, Bomb Squad-style of production--hip-hop is now in a clear state of emergency. The return of Chuck D is warranted. On this 15th-anniversary CD, he wastes no time launching into anti-jiggy tirades on &quot;Put It Up,&quot; where he skewers today's emcees: &quot;Tycoons, damn I'm tired of these coons / Rappin' in circles, words can either help you or hurt you.&quot; In fact, some of the new material on the album is as thought-provoking as any of PE's older material. &quot;Son of a Bush,&quot; produced by Professor Griff, dissects two generations of flawed Bush presidencies. However, the willingness to take creative risks can also have its downside. Contest-winning fans got to remix four Public Enemy hits, including &quot;Shut 'Em Down&quot; (Austria's DJ Functionist) and &quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot; (Jeronimo Punx). While the interactive nature of the project is admirable, DJ Functionist is no Pete Rock and Jeronimo Punx's postmodern twist on &quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot; only makes you crave to hear the original version again. In the end, the live cuts (such as &quot;Welcome to the Terrordome&quot;) and the so-so remixes bog down what would have otherwise been a tighter project. The often eloquent Revolverlution is no It Takes a Nation of Millions, but then again, what is? --Dalton Higgins\n\nTrack Listings\n1. Give The Peeps What They Need\n2. Revolverlution\n3. Uzi\n4.
