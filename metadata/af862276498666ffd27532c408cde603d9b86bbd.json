Palast focused on the politics of petroleum. Max focused on the economics of petroleum. Those are two very different topics, which means that a lot of the disagreement you seemed to hear was really the two talking past each other. They both agree that the petroleum industry is a problem, but their respective emphases leads them to focus on different solutions.\n\nPalast views the theory of Peak Oil to be irrelevant to the politics of petroleum, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right. &quot;The price of Oil is not in anyway today effected by supply...&quot;  That does not mean that he denies Peak Oil (which he may, he just didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do so in this interview).\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
