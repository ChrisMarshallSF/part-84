It was released in December, before the movie, for all major consoles. It was declared the last game by Shiny Entertainment before they merged with The Collective.\n\nStory\n\nBased on the book (under both the names The Northern Lights and in some countries, The Golden Compass) and movie, players assume the role of Lyra Belacqua and Iorek Byrnison in Lyra's attempt to get the golden compass (alethiometer) to her uncle, Lord Asriel which she presumes is what the master of Jordan college wanted her to do, and to save her friend, Roger from the General Oblation Board.\n\nIn some sections, the game actually follows the book more closely than the film. The sequences in Bolvangar and Svalbard are switched in the film but remain unchanged in the game. Also, some of the ending (unseen in the film) is shown in the game. That makes the game the only place, thus far, to view these deleted scenes.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//  _ |_  _ \\ \\/ /_  _  _  \\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\\n//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\ (_||_)(_|/ /\\ \\_||_ | | //\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\n\nChecking for updates to abgx360.dat...\n     Server file abgx360.dat no newer than local file - not retrieving\n\nG:\\Xbox 360\\+ROMS\\Golden Compass\\GoldenCompass.dvd needs to be created\nG:\\Xbox 360\\+ROMS\\Golden Compass\\GoldenCompass.dvd was created\n\nChecking Game\n     ISO: &quot;G:\\Xbox 360\\+ROMS\\Golden Compass\\GoldenCompass.iso&quot;\n     Size: 7835492352 bytes\n     Files in ISO: 107, Folders in ISO: 8\n     Total bytes used: 6033016007 (82.66%)\nGame appears to have random padding\n\nChecking default.xex\n     Original PE Filename:  Matrix3X360.exe\n     Original PE Timestamp: 2007/11/09 20:55:46\n     Game Name:             The Golden Compass\n     Developer:             Shiny\n     Publisher:             SEGA\n     Genre:                 Fantasy Adventure\n     No Avatar Awards\n     Achievements:          16 Achievements totaling 1000 Gamerscore\n     XEX CRC = 9BBDC40F\n     XEX Media ID: 879DBDFF7069FFE30061845E-6EBD7F3F\n\nRegion Code: 0x000000FF\n     NTSC/U\n\nChecking SS\n     Timestamp of Authoring: 2007/11/12 00:00:00\n     Timestamp of Mastering: 2007/11/19 18:16:37\n     SS Version: 1\n     SS CRC = 12EDF545 (RawSS = BF62573D)\n     SS Media ID: 879DBDFF7069FFE30061845E-6EBD7F3F (matches game)\nSS looks valid\n\nChecking DMI\n     Timestamp of Authoring: 2007/11/12 00:00:00 (matches SS)\n     DMI CRC = 9E88B70F\n     DMI Media ID: 879DBDFF7069FFE30061845E-6EBD7F3F (matches game)\nDMI looks valid\n\nChecking PFI\n     PFI CRC = A4CFB59C\nPFI matches known data (2nd Wave)\n\nVideo partition found\n     Video CRC = 91410773 (V0 = 81DF6964, V1 = E47F6A94)\nVideo partition matches known data (2nd Wave)\n\nBasic Stealth check passed!\n\nStarting Verification\n     Looking for 12EDF5459BBDC40F.ini in the online verified database\n     Server file 12EDF5459BBDC40F.ini no newer than local file - not retrieving\n\n     Using 12EDF5459BBDC40F.ini (292 bytes)\n     Video CRC matches\n     V0    CRC matches\n     V1    CRC matches\n     PFI   CRC matches\n     DMI   CRC matches\n     SS    CRC matches\n     Xex   CRC matches\n     AnyDVD style corruption was not detected\n     Game CRC = 1190A733 (matches)\n\nAll CRCs match\nVerification was successful!\n\nSplitVid is valid\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05342f2d6e13721085f6749a639bbbab37f8d715","amp;dn":"Golden+Compass+for+Xbox+360+%28NTSC%2FU+from+AcidReignFalls%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05342f2d6e13721085f6749a639bbbab37f8d715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,52,47,45,110,19,114,16,133,246,116,154,99,155,187,171,55,248,215,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
