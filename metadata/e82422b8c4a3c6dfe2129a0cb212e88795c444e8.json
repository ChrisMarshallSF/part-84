It focuses on a team of forensic pathologists: Dr. Harry Cunningham (Tom Ward), Dr. Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox) and Professor Leo Dalton (William Gaminara).\nBased in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Thomas Lyell CentreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - a hi-tech scientific laboratory set within the grounds of a university - the pathologists painstakingly examine the bodies of the deceased to search for vital clues that may reveal the cause of death. Their expert analysis very often leads to crucial discoveries being made which enable the police to identify and apprehend those responsible for the crime. However, sometimes their passion, sense of humanity and commitment to justice causes them to put their own lives in danger to ensure the criminal is caught.\nWith average weekly viewing figures regularly above 6 million in the UK, Silent Witness is back in 2011 for its 14th series. A bold, challenging and exciting drama, the show continues to explore contemporary issues through clever and thrilling crime mysteries.\n\nSeason finale:\n\nThe Prodigal\n\nProfessor Leo DaltonWilliam Gaminara\nDr Harry CunninghamTom Ward\nDr Nikki AlexanderEmilia Fox\nZak KhanArsher AliCI \nRebecca WoodsKate Ashfield\nKlara van BurenMarene Vanholk\nPieter van BurenDerek de Lint\nDS MansfieldLorcan Cranitch\nKatharineVictoria Carling\nConstable Ryan BarlowTony Lucken\nDr James SabistonOliver \nChrisJackAustin Moulton\nTrudy van BurenStephanie CareySgt \nCraig WhiteheadMatthew McNulty\nMary OlivantSarah Solemani\nDiederick van BurenWilliam Brand\nDC Sophie RazviFarzana Dua Elahe\nJacob van BurenJake Hathaway\nReporter 1Anna Anderson\nYoung KlaraCorrine Vrensen\nDutch Security OfficerJoe Montanna\nDirectorJames Strong\nProducerRichard Burrell\nWriterMichael Crompton\n\n\nMon 31 Jan 201121:00BBC One\nWed 2 Feb 201122:30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e82422b8c4a3c6dfe2129a0cb212e88795c444e8","amp;dn":"Silent+Witness+-+S14+Finale+-+The+Prodigal+-+no+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e82422b8c4a3c6dfe2129a0cb212e88795c444e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,36,34,184,196,163,198,223,226,18,154,12,178,18,232,135,149,196,68,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
