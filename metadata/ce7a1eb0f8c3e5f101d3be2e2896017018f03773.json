They took their name from the French word for a bowler hat, a referral to a clothing stereotype of the 1960s Britain. The bowler was a symbol of the stodgy businessman, which became an representational symbol of the surrealist artist, RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Magritte. Their best known song is a French language retake of the song My Generation, by The Who. Chapeaumelon contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the American movie Eurotrip.\n\n\n* Charles Boyer (vocals &amp; guitar)\n* FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Therriault (guitar &amp; back vocals)\n* Sylvain Larose (bass guitar &amp; back vocals)\n* Jean-Pierre DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©carie (drums &amp; back vocals)\n\n2002 Chapeaumelon\n2008 Bonjour Bonsoir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7a1eb0f8c3e5f101d3be2e2896017018f03773","amp;dn":"Chapeaumelon+-+Full+Discography+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7a1eb0f8c3e5f101d3be2e2896017018f03773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,122,30,176,248,195,229,241,1,211,190,46,40,150,1,112,24,240,55,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
