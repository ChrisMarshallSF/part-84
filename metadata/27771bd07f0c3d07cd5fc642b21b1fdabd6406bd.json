Far richer and more focused than the Voodoo releases, The Big Heat teems with low-lifes, and misfits and lives in crisis, but all are drawn with a crime novelist's sense of tension and mystery and a keen eye for compassion. All the trademarks are here and finally crystallized; (the pregnant atmosphere, a sense of impending dread, deeply spooky electronics, and an alchemist's approach to genre and instrumentation) while anchoring them firmly in a rich tradition of American literature, film, myth and popular culture. A stark portrait of a haunted country. \n\nNo less than esteemed music critic Greil Marcus wrote in Artforum that year...&quot;Ridgway is playing with the possibilities of the flat, dead - pan tone Raymond Chandler identified - he's also looking for the way , as Chandler wrote, that American language comes 'alive to cliches,' seeks naturally to make them, to make a language everyone can understand without a second thought.The stories are made as ordinary as dirt - and yet The Big Heat is probably the most compelling portrait of American social life to appear on a rock 'n roll record since Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska.&quot; \nThe album blasted off with an unlikely top 5 international hit in Europe, with the ironic, 7-minute long, Vietnam ghost saga, &quot;Camouflage&quot;. Ridgway and his band Chapter Eleven set off on a world-wide tour over the next two years, which took them through the U.S., Great Britain, Europe, Scandinavia, Puerto Rico, Australia and points in between. \n\n\nPersonnel\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ K.
