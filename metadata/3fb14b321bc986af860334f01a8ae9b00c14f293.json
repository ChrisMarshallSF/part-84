The first episodes have very little movement at all, and it gets only slightly better as the series progresses. What saves the day is that these stories are very imaginative and full of whimsy and charm. Once you have the patience to sit through the crude artwork, it kind of grows on you and draws you in. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb14b321bc986af860334f01a8ae9b00c14f293","amp;dn":"Crusader+Rabbit+vs.+The+State+of+Texas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb14b321bc986af860334f01a8ae9b00c14f293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,177,75,50,27,201,134,175,134,3,52,240,26,138,233,176,12,20,242,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
