He's a surprisingly soulful singer, in a less-polished, B.B. King sort of way, and his constant solos never drown the focus of a catchy acoustic song like &quot;Mean Old Airplane&quot; or an electric stomper like &quot;Stormy Seas.&quot; Ultimately, this 1993 CD is for guitar aficionados--Dave Hole's playing mimics his voice perfectly on the title track, and his slide achieves an Allman Brothers-style moan on Big Bill Broonzy's standard &quot;Keys to the Highway.&quot; --Steve Knopper\n\nTracklist\n1.
