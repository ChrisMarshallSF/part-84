The folk-country arrangement, a \n\ntasteful mix of acoustic guitar, dobro, bass, drums, Wurlitzer, accordion, \n\nelectric guitar, and harmony, is spare and filled with open spaces. Fayssoux \n\nhandles the vocal with feeling, adding a touch of country ache, but never \n\noversinging. This simple approach quietly underpins the song, allowing the \n\nemotion to rise to the top naturally. This unassuming quality works equally \n\nwell on the opener, the sadly sweet &quot;The Blackest Crow,&quot; and the closer, a \n\njubilant take on &quot;Weepin' Mary.&quot; On the first, the song is underpinned by \n\nLloyd Green's lovely steel work, and the harmony is bolstered by Emmylou \n\nHarris; on the latter, Fayssoux is joined on vocals by Sharon and Cheryl \n\nWhite and by mandolinist Ricky Skaggs. On occasion, Fayssoux adds variety \n\nto the overall blueprint, as when she cuts loose on the high-flying &quot;Save It! \n\nSave It! with duet partner Peter Cooper (who also produced), and her song \n\nchoices, from gospel to country to contemporary folk, generate a solid set list \n\nfor Early. All of these qualities--solid songs, lively performances, and well-sung \n\nvocals--create a down-to-earth album that sounds good and that is easy to \n\nenjoy. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/26/fayssoux/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/26/fayssoux/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:077ba0e8d2d40bad0602dc10aaa4fd6f72e82016","amp;dn":"Fayssoux...Early%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"077ba0e8d2d40bad0602dc10aaa4fd6f72e82016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,123,160,232,210,212,11,173,6,2,220,16,170,164,253,111,114,232,32,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
