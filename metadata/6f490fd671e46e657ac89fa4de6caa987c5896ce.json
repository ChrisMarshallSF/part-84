Set in Earth 16, the show will focus on the heroes trying to see if they have what it takes to use their powers for good (without the aid and guidance of their leaders) while trying to overcome typical problems that come with a teenage personal life at the same time.\n\n\n\\&quot;Drop Zone\\&quot;   January 28, 2011 (2011-01-28)[2] 104 \nDespite lacking a clear leader, the gang is assigned its first mission by Batman.
