A Better Finder Rename knows how to extract EXIF shooting date and time information from digital camera images and exploit them in creating sequence numbers or adding time and date information to the file name. Support for all major RAW formats (including JPEG, CRW, CR2, THM, NEF, TIFF, RAJ, ORF , MRW, DNG, PEF, SRF, etc.) extends this to professional photographers. Even multiple shots captured in the same second are dealt with reliably.\n\nSystem administrators, web masters and other power users will appreciate advanced features, such as regular expression support, conversion to Windows NTFS/SMB compatible names, the ability to import file names from a database, a spreadsheet or any other source that can produce plain or tab-delimited text files. Last but not least, the ability to save a record of the current and new file names greatly facilitates tracking your files.\n\nMusic lovers can use the built-in MP3/AAC support to exploit the id3 meta-data tags embedded in most music files to create their own naming schemes for their music collection. Meta-data information from MP3, AAC and iTunes music store files are supported.\n\nThe multi-step renaming feature allows multiple renaming steps to be combined to deal with complex renaming jobs in a single operation. Unlike other tools, A Better Finder Rename allows any number of renaming actions to be combined, re-ordered, copied and deleted. You may even save frequently used sets into presets.\nSelf-contained droplet mini-applications allow recurring tasks to be automated. Save your current settings to a droplet and apply them instantly by dropping the files onto the droplet application icon. Double click the droplet to edit the settings.\n\nPowerful Renaming Engine\n\nVersion 8 takes file renaming to a new level of sophistication by introducing an advanced 64-bit multi-threaded renaming engine that solves many problems that other file reamers simply leave unaddressed. The database-backed renaming engine automatically resolves file name conflicts (when several files would end up sharing the same name) using a range of configurable parameters. The sequence in which files are renamed is optimized to avoid deadlocks which could occur when the order in which the files are renamed becomes significant.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X.6\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506f3875aa2c0e3d1a62a5f26851b1e901a5051c","amp;dn":"A+Better+Finder+Rename+8.78+%2B+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506f3875aa2c0e3d1a62a5f26851b1e901a5051c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,111,56,117,170,44,14,61,26,98,165,242,104,81,177,233,1,165,5,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
