He evokes his wild childhood, his encounters with the great names in the music world, his performance debuts, and his activities as a concert artist in the troubled Soviet Union. Acerbic and unpredictable, Richter reveals himself here with disarming candour and humour. The programme includes previously unseen archival footage, a wealth of performance excerpts, and works by the following composers: Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, Liszt, Mozart, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Ravel, Saint-Saens, Schubert, Shostakovich, and more.\n\n\n\nlanguage: french, russian\n\nsubtitles: english, french, german\n\n\n\n\nplease keep seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:833b89ca69460056f16bd1045b0eafa86d4469b2","amp;dn":"Richter%2C+the+Enigma+2DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"833b89ca69460056f16bd1045b0eafa86d4469b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,59,137,202,105,70,0,86,241,107,209,4,91,14,175,168,109,68,105,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
