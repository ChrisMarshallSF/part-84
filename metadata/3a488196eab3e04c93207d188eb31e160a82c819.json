Whether ... taking a moody tack for the title track, or cooking up a swinging boogie beat ... [he] keeps his solos simple, tasty, and to the point. Actually, he hails from the Kent, Ohio area, and by no stretch is he the portliest bluesman in Northeast Ohio, ( I could name several of far greater girth,) but Mark Hahn, AKA Cleveland Fats, has crafted a 'mainline blues' tour-de-force that assures him the right to carry such a kingly moniker. The blues mavens at Atlanta's Ichiban Records agreed, making Cleveland Fats their most recent blues-artist signing.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n\n01. Wanna Know (4:57)\n02. Worst Kind of Fool (4:27)\n03.
