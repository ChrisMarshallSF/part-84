As the program progresses, Erpelding talks about the safety reasons for properly positioning one's wood and tools on the table. He works with some of the initial design work that will help students fit pieces of wood together, and he also starts shaping a dovetail slip joint, mortise-and-tenon joints, and other complex pieces. Various hand tools are featured as Erpelding cleans the surfaces of the finished joints.\n\nBooks\n02 DeCristoforo - The Magic of Your Radial Arm Saw\n03 Wally Kunkel-How To Master The Radial Saw\n04 Jon Eakes - Fine Tuning Your Radial Arm Saw\n05 Delta-Getting the Most Out of Your Radial Saw 1956\n06 ShopNotes #16 - Customize Your Radial Arm Saw\n\nOther Info:\nVarious files on Dewalt Radial Saws and Accessories\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7aa53cb7c1bc4a34f154df1816831eeb0cfadb","amp;dn":"Radial-Arm-Saw+Joinery%3A+Fine+Woodworking+Workshops+%26Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7aa53cb7c1bc4a34f154df1816831eeb0cfadb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,122,165,60,183,193,188,74,52,241,84,223,24,22,131,30,235,12,250,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
