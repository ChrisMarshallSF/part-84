ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe addition of LavalysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ customers and technologies will enable us to accelerate investments, meet a wider set of customer needs through a richer solution set, increase efficiencies and significantly expand our opportunities for growth.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBeginning immediately, FinalWire will execute on the planned integration of the two companiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ technologies and customers to ensure a smooth transition that will deliver immediate value for customers, partners and investors.\n\n\nDescriptiption:\n64-bit benchmarks &amp; 64-bit System Stability Test\nAll CPU, FPU and memory benchmarks are fully ported to 64-bit, utilizing MMX, 3DNow! and SSE instruction set extensions, and scale up to 32 processor cores. An enhanced 64-bit System Stability Test module is also available to stress the whole system to its limits. For legacy processors all benchmarks and the System Stability Test are available in 32-bit version as well.\n\nHash benchmark with SSE2 &amp; SSSE3 optimizations\nA brand new 64-bit security benchmark to measure CPU performance using the SHA1 hashing algorythm. The Hash benchmark is optimized for every popular AMD, Intel and VIA processor core variants by utilizing the appropriate MMX, MMX+/SSE, SSE2, or SSSE3 instruction set extension. It is hardware accelerated on VIA PadLock Security Engine capable VIA C7 and VIA Nano processors.\n\nSSD database with SSD-specific SMART disk health status\nAIDA64 further extends its exhaustive hardware database by adding 300 solid-state drives (SSD), making the database count over 115,000 entries total. On top of the usual ATA auto-detect information the new SSD database enables AIDA64 to display flash memory type, controller model, physical dimensions, and data transfer performance data. AIDA64 v1.00 also implements SSD-specific SMART disk health information for Indilinx, Intel, JMicron, Samsung, and SandForce controllers.\n\nFine-tunable Alerting module\nOverheating, over-voltage, and cooling fan alerts are now fine-tunable with alert sound and emergency application launch.\n\nIn AIDA64 alert methods are individually customizable for each alert triggers.\n\nDIMM thermal sensor, QST 2.0, Koolance TMS-200 support\nThe real-time hardware monitoring module was further improved by adding Intel QST 2.0, Koolance TMS-200, Koolance TMS-EB200, and DIMM thermal sensor device support. Improved cooling fan speed measurement on Fintek, ITE and Winbond sensor chips. Sensor support for the latest Fintek, Nuvoton and SMSC hardware monitoring devices.\n\nSupport for the latest graphics technologies\nGraphics processor and GPGPU details, temperature and cooling fan monitoring for the latest GPUs: AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5430/5450, AMD Radeon E4690, AMD Radeon HD 5550, AMD Radeon HD 6850/6870, nVIDIA GeForce GTS 450, nVIDIA GeForce GTX 460, nVIDIA GeForce GTX 465, nVIDIA GeForce GTX 580. Exhaustive Direc3D and OpenGL video card capabilities detection with DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.1 support.  \n\nWhat's New:\ndetection of AMD Catalyst 11.1 driver\ndetection of AMD Catalyst 11.1a driver\nextended reference OpenGL Extensions list (for AMD Cayman)\nimproved hot-plug storage device support\nimproved disk temperature measurement for Intel ICH/PCH RAID controllers\nimproved disk temperature measurement for JMicron RAID controllers\nchipset information for Intel ICH8 Series (with Pineview)\nchipset information for Intel ICH9 Series (with Pineview)\nGPU I2C support for AMD Radeon HD 6xxx\nHD Audio codec information for nVIDIA GF114\nmotherboard specific sensor info for Asus P8P67 WS Revolution\nmotherboard specific sensor info for MSI MS-7672\nfixed: Motherboard / Memory / pagefile usage display issues\n\n\nSystem Requirements\nAIDA64 Extreme Edition is designed to run on 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems. It can be run directly from an optical disc, but in such case any configuration changes made in the Preferences of the software will be lost.\n\nSystem requirements in detail:\nOperating system:\nWindows 95/98/Me\nWindows NT4/2000\nWindows XP\nWindows XP x64 Edition\nWindows PE\nWindows Server 2003\nWindows Vista\nWindows Vista x64 Edition\nWindows Server 2008\nWindows 7\nWindows Server 2008 R2\n\nProcessor: Pentium or later\nSystem memory: 32 MB or more. CPU, FPU and memory benchmarks require at least 128 MB system memory.\nRequired disk space to install: 20 MB\n\n\nInstallation:\n1. Un-RAR to any Folder.\n2. Run Program. (On Vista or Win 7 Right Click and Run as Administrator)\n3. If License Window Pops up Use a Keygen to generate Serial and Use it to Register.\n4.
