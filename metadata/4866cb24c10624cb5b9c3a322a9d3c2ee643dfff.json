Williamson outlines the fine hashes socialism and Communism have made in the countries in which they have been imposed.&quot; --National Review\n\n&quot;Required reading.&quot; --Mark Levin Show\nProduct Description\n\nStalinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gulag, impoverished North Korea, collapsing Cuba...itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to name a dogma that has failed as spectacularly as socialism. And yet leaders around the world continue to subject millions of people to this dysfunctional, violence-prone ideology. \n\nIn The Politically Incorrect GuideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ to Socialism, Kevin Williamson reveals the fatal flaw of socialismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that efficient, complex economies simply canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be centrally planned. But even in America, that hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stopped politicians and bureaucrats from planning, to various extents, the most vital sectors of our economy: public education, energy, and the most arrogant centralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“planning effort of them all, ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s healthcare plan. \n\nIn this provocative book, Williamson unfolds the grim history of socialism, showing how the ideology has spawned crushing poverty, devastating famines, and horrific wars. Lumbering from one crisis to the next, leaving a trail of economic devastation and environmental catastrophe, socialism has wreaked more havoc, caused more deaths, and impoverished more people than any other ideology in historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially when you include the victims of fascism, which Williamson notes is simply a variant of socialism. \n\nWilliamson further demonstrates:\n\nWhy, contrary to popular belief, socialism in theory is no better than socialism in practice\nWhy socialism canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exist without capitalism\nHow the energy powerhouse of Venezuela, under socialism, has become an economic basket case subject to rationing and blackouts \nHow socialism, not British colonialism, plunged the bountiful economy of India into stagnation and dysfunctionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how capitalism is rescuing it\nWhy socialism is inextricably linked to communism\n\nIf you thought socialism went into the dustbin of history with the collapse of the Soviet Union, think again. Socialism is alive and kicking, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already spread further than you know.
