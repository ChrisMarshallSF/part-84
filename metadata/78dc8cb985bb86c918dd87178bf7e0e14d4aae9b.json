In a professional career that lasted 60 years, he demonstrated a remarkable ability to maintain his appeal and pursue his musical goals despite often countervailing trends. He came to the fore during the swing era of the 1930s and '40s, helped to define the &quot;sing era&quot; of the '40s and '50s, and continued to attract listeners during the rock era that began in the mid-'50s. He scored his first number one hit in 1940 and was still making million-selling recordings in 1994. This popularity was a mark of his success at singing and promoting the American popular song as it was written, particularly in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s. He was able to take the work of great theater composers of that period, such as Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Richard Rodgers, and reinterpret their songs for later audiences in a way that led to their rediscovery and their permanent enshrinement as classics. On records and in live performances, on film, radio, and television, he consistently sang standards in a way that demonstrated their perennial appeal.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tExact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nCue File:\t\tYes\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tVocal\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\t\t\t\nLabel: \t\t\tEMI/Capitol\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Young At Heart\n02.All The Way\n03.Witchcraft\n04.Nice 'N' Easy\n05.My Funny Valentine\n06.I Get A Kick Out Of You\n07.The Lady Is A Tramp\n08.I've Got You Under My Skin\n09.Three Coins In The Fountain\n10.Same Old Saturday Night\n11.Don't Worry 'Bout Me\n12.Chicago\n\n\nNote: I didn't include the log file in the torrent for technical reasons.
