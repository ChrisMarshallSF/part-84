and mystery,  Golden Rendezvous  is a  heady mix  of\n        action and  suspense set  on the  high seas  of the  Caribbean\n        Ocean.\n\n        Aboard the converted passenger liner SS Campari, Chief Officer\n        John Carter  (Richard Harris,  Gladiator) senses  something is\n        drastically afoot after sabotage is attributed to a succession\n        of unfortunate  delays. When  a crew  member goes  missing the\n        rising mood of jeopardy suddenly turns violent, thrusting  the\n        whole ship into instant turmoil. Armed with an atomic  device,\n        master criminal Luis Carreras  (John Vernon, The Outlaw  Josey\n        Wales)  hijacks the  ship and  intends to  ransom his  wealthy\n        passengers for the golden contents of a US Treasury ship.\n\n        With the  stakes raised,  it is  up to  Carter and his rag-tag\n        crew to overcome the odds and rescue the hostages before  time\n        runs  out.  Featuring  character  stalwarts  Burgess  Meredith\n        (Rocky)  and  Gordon  Jackson  (The  Whistle  Blower),  Golden\n        Rendezvous speeds along in the gripping tradition of Die  Hard\n        and Under Siege.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                   Richard Harris    ....
