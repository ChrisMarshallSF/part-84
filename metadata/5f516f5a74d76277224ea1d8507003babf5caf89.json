It takes viewers on a journey with Professor of Geological Sciences Roger Bilham - in Japan only days after the earthquake struck. The programme follows Roger as he sets off to view the devastation from the air. In the magnitude 9 earthquake Japan shifted 12 feet towards the US. The earth was knocked off its axis and the rate of the earth's rotation was changed. This was one of the biggest earthquakes every measured: the ground along the east side of Japan dropped by almost 10 feet, making the tsunami catastrophic. This documentary also follows renowned journalist Callum Macrae as he travels to the north, where the towns of Sendai and Ofunato used to be bustling fishing villages.\n\nPioneer Production for Channel 4.\n\nCh4 Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/japans-tsunami-how-it-happened/4od&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/japans-tsunami-how-it-happened/4od&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 46mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.41 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid also available at forums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f516f5a74d76277224ea1d8507003babf5caf89","amp;dn":"Ch4+Japans+Tsunami+How+it+Happened+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f516f5a74d76277224ea1d8507003babf5caf89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,81,111,90,116,215,98,119,34,78,161,216,80,112,3,186,191,92,175,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
