Led by quarterback Aaron \n Rodgers, who would go on to win the MVP award for the game, the Packers\n face down the vaunted Steelers defense. Additional highlights from Packers'\n entire historic season are included, from opening day, to their mid-season\n struggles as they lost key players to injury, to their incredible string\n of playoff victories as they became the NFC's first six seed to make it\n to the Super Bowl. \n\n                  ** This is not the Game in its entirety\n          \n                         Big up all scene massive! \n       \n        \n\n                                                                 \n                            GROUP INFORMATION\n                            \n                  10 Years of the Force and still going strong\n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro/asia sites\n           * Fios/Cable BluRay rippers or TV cappers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:507ac8b441ecae2e04e71d3f4d5866764267f1cd","amp;dn":"NFL.Super.Bowl.XLV.Green.Bay.Packers.Champions.2011.BDRip.XviD-a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"507ac8b441ecae2e04e71d3f4d5866764267f1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,122,200,180,65,236,174,46,4,231,29,63,77,88,102,118,66,103,241,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
