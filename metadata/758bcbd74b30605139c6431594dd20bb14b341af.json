The main game was released for Windows on January 2007, and was later ported to Mac OS X by Virtual Programming on 2 November 2007.\n\nPlayers have many options to shape their countries. Forms of government include various kingdoms, republics, theocracies, and tribal governments. Players can influence a nation's society and values by adjusting &quot;sliders&quot; such as free trade/mercantilism, and may hire court advisors such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. As the game advances, players can pick &quot;national ideas&quot; such as LibertÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°galitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, FraternitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, which give specialized bonuses.\n\nThe current version of the game has over 300 playable countries, including giants like Ming China, regional powers like Bohemia and Kazan, and tiny nations (&quot;one-province minors&quot;) like the Maldives. Without formal victory conditions, players sometimes set goals for themselves like raising a minor city-state to world prominence. The world map includes some 1,700 provinces and sea zones. Many provinces in the Americas, Africa, and Oceania are not owned by any country, allowing for colonization.\n\nEconomics in the early modern era is simulated by taxes and production income from provinces, as well as trade. National merchants compete in &quot;centers of trade&quot; such as Venice and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼beck, and nations focused on trading income (i.e., Holland) enjoy significant advantages. Nations which mint too much currency, or are over-reliant on gold mining, are penalized by inflation. Technology investment is important in the long run; the game does not use a Civ-style tech tree, but instead has several different technology categories, which unlock new military units and buildings.\nDiplomacy is rather detailed: royal marriages, insults, alliances, trade embargoes, and so on all affect relations between countries. Players may be able to gain control over other countries peacefully through personal unions and vassalage. Early international institutions such as the Holy Roman Empire and Papal Curia are simulated in some depth. Every country has its own culture and religion, a frequent source of diplomatic unity or friction.\n\nRulers have control over armies, navies, and mercenaries they recruit. Combat is abstracted, with no direct control over battles (contrast the Total War games). Military tradition is necessary for recruiting good generals and admirals. Aggression (seizing provinces without a rightful claim) is checked by the &quot;badboy&quot; system of international infamy common to Paradox's games.\n\nThe game is very historically detailed; one can play the &quot;grand campaign&quot; starting in 1453 or 1399, but any date before the French Revolution is a valid starting point as well, with historical leaders and countries appropriately updated. Major events such as the War of the League of Cambrai are playable this way. Often the game diverges from reality after centuries in-game, with unhistorical events such as Portugal colonizing North America, or Poland-Lithuania surviving to bully its neighbors.\n\nThe game may be played single-player or multiplayer, with players controlling different countries; every non-human country is controlled by its own AI.\nMost of the game's settings are in plain text files that are easily changed to modify the map, historical events, etc. Some popular mods extensively change the game, adding historical flavor, fantasy scenarios, or new game mechanics.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nNo cracks are needed; just drag the .app file into the Applications folder to play. \n\nThis is a Cider port, (Divine Wind hasn't been released for Mac yet) so Intel Macs only. \n\nGet rid of the manila colored bar at the bottom, should it appear, by clicking on it then the game screen.\n\nThis is my first torrent, please seed &amp; comment if any problems arise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:758bcbd74b30605139c6431594dd20bb14b341af","amp;dn":"Europa+Universalis+III%3A+Divine+Wind+for+Mac+%28Cider+Port%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"758bcbd74b30605139c6431594dd20bb14b341af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,139,203,215,75,48,96,81,57,198,67,21,148,221,32,187,20,179,65,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
