Some of the originators of the Bay Area sound and more importantly a band that comes out of that now household name toddlin' town of Seattle, Metal Church are back in original line up sans Craig Wells. Smoking and chugging along without skipping a metallic beat, everyone's favorite pastors prove they can still blast away at the metal masses with skill and juicy riffery. Dave Wayne's vocal performance is now more solid and rooted. Served up right in a picky metalhead era. Nice to see Dave's absence didn't cause him to lose track with the times. Sure Kurdt Vanderhoof is the main driving force and influence, as he has been throughout their career, this guy is an unsung genius. Last few albums have been lyrical as well as musical gemstones and it doesn't stop here! Opening freight train &quot;Sleeps With Thunder&quot;, &quot;Falldown&quot; and mid-album monsters &quot;Kiss For The Dead&quot; and &quot;Faster Than Life&quot; are classics, &quot;Sand Kings&quot; is a cold steel genius of an album ender. Glad to see K.V. is back in the lineup after a solo stint. One shortcoming, bad choice in cover tunes with the yawner Aerosmith drip-tune &quot;Toys in The Attic&quot;, which really isn't a good song no matter who serves it up.\n\nby Shawn H\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Sleeps With Thunder.wma                                          \n02 - Falldown.wma                                                     \n03 - Into Dust.wma                                                    \n04 - Kiss Fo The Dead.wma                                             \n05 - Lb.
