In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a\ntarget number of points, which is typically achieved by performing tasks\nfor the city's local crime syndicate. Each level has its own unique set of\ntasks. Successful completion of a mission rewards the player with points\nand opens the opportunity to attempt harder missions for higher rewards,\nwhile failure awards few points and may permanently seal off opportunities\nfor more tasks.\n\nEnjoy!
