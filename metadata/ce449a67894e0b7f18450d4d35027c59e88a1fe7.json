The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce449a67894e0b7f18450d4d35027c59e88a1fe7","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+Connect+-+Red+-+8.200+-+Spanish+-+CDROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce449a67894e0b7f18450d4d35027c59e88a1fe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,68,154,103,137,78,11,127,24,69,13,77,53,2,124,89,232,138,31,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
