It was written from 1913 onwards. Although it was shown to selected friends, such as Christopher Isherwood, it was only published in 1971 after Forster's death.\nThe novel is remarkable for its time in describing same-sex love in a non-condemnatory way. Forster resisted publication because of public and legal attitudes to homosexuality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a note found on the manuscript read: &quot;Publishable, but worth it?&quot;. Forster was particularly keen that his novel should have a happy ending, but knew that this would make the book too controversial. However, by the time he died, British attitudes and law had changed.*\n\nAudible restricted this item for purchasing in my area. Help me fuck audible by sharing this book wherever you can.
