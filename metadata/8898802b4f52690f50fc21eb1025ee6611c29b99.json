This dvd contains six episodes, each covering a different type of engine - the imperial steam engine, the workhorse diesel, the exhilarating supercharger, the laid back v8, the noisy, smelly two-stroke, and the jet, the engine that went on to shrink the world. This is the highly-acclaimed channel 4 television series - a celebration of design, engineering and individual genius. If you want to see a man single-handedly remove the engine from a trabant, or toast marshmallows in the afterburner of a military jet aircraft, then this is the film for you - the guardian. I have a confession to make says robbie coltrane. I am a nosey bastard. I am incapable of walking past a piece of machinery without wanting to know all the details of its private life.\n\nPart 5. The Noisy/Smelly 2 Stroke\nRobbie Coltrane traces the development of the small but noisy two-stroke engine. Its cheap simplicity helped to rebuild the ailing postwar economy in East Germany withthe production of the Trabant but in the west it was mainly used for leisure in such machines as lawnmowers, snowmobiles, model planes and boats.\n\nIMDB Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBFI Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 23 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 336 MB\nSource: DVDRip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8898802b4f52690f50fc21eb1025ee6611c29b99","amp;dn":"Coltranes+Planes+and+Automobiles+5of6+Xvid+AC3+MVGroup+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8898802b4f52690f50fc21eb1025ee6611c29b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,152,128,43,79,82,105,15,80,252,33,235,16,37,238,102,17,194,155,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
