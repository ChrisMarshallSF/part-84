This should work on any CFW running 3.55 (Will probably work on lower firmwares as well, but no guarantees). Any backup manager should work as well (Tested on Multiman).\n\nHere are some installation instructions and information:\n\n1. Simply download the game and unzip it.\n\n2. You can either copy it to a flash drive or FTP it to your PS3. Save it to your GAMEZ folder.\n\n3. Open your preferred backup manager and launch Fallout: New Vegas. (I wouldn\\\\\\'t run it directly because I have not tested that to see if it works. It won\\\\\\'t hurt to try, but the resolution may be messed up)\n\n4. It should return you to the XMB and instead of your inserted game being in there, it will show Fallout: New Vegas in there instead.\n\nFor any complications or questions, feel free to email me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;85cee4ffe4f6eee4f1e0f7b4b7b6c5e2e8e4ece9abe6eae8ab&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; Also, please check out my Youtube channel at\n\nNote: This is a new torrent, so I will be seeding as long as I can. Please stick with it and allow other people to download it as well. That way we get a good flow of seeders going.\n\n\nRipped By: Syllith (Kazaskater)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adfc4ca3cc2c0da8a847f932f907b31ca78db630","amp;dn":"Fallout%3A+New+Vegas+-+PS3+%28Syllith%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adfc4ca3cc2c0da8a847f932f907b31ca78db630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,252,76,163,204,44,13,168,168,71,249,50,249,7,179,28,167,141,182,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
