During his drug reign he controlled 80% of all the cocaine smuggled into the United States. He was listed in Forbes Magazine as the 3rd richest person in the world with a net worth in excess of 3 billion dollars. He was one of Columbia's founding members of the Medellin cartel and he ruled with an iron fist. Escobar killed Police, Judges, Lawyers, Military personnel and anybody who stood in his way. Escobar is credited with the &quot;Columbian Necktie,&quot; slicing a victim's throat and pulling their tongue through their throat. He was a man intent on not dying the way he was born: Poor. With all this, escobar is still considered a saint to some. He helped this countrymen by buying homes, fixing soccer stadiums an re-building neighborhoods. These actions have fueled debates both casting him as a devil and as an angel. AS IS brings the story allowing you to decide. Watch this incredible story and witness the mentality that continues to dominate today's illegal drug trade.\n\n\nSPECIAL COMMENTARIES FROM THE KEY PLAYERS FROM LEGENDARY FILMS / DOCUMENTARIES 'SCARFACE,' 'COCAINE COWBOYS,' and BET's 'AMERICAN GANGSTER' series\n\nSteven Bauer - &quot;Manny Ribera&quot; from SCARFACE\nAngel Salazar - &quot;Chi Chi&quot; from SCARFACE\nThe Real Rick Ross - FreewayEnterprise.com\nCharles Cosby - COCAINE COWBOYS #2\n\nScreenshots\n\n[IMG]http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/9595/snapshot20110210042841.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1337/snapshot20110210042900.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/5323/snapshot20110210042950.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/6517/snapshot20110210043014.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/475/snapshot20110210043101.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAudio/ Video\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x576 29.97fps [VideoHandler]\nAudio: AAC 44100Hz stereo [SoundHandler]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1bf2d95ecdfcbd547da8c24d2136161a74915ff","amp;dn":"As+Is%7E+Escobar+Season+Has+Returned+%5B2009%5DDvdrip+-GOD-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1bf2d95ecdfcbd547da8c24d2136161a74915ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,191,45,149,236,223,203,213,71,218,140,36,210,19,97,97,167,73,21,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
