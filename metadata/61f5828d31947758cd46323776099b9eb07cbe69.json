From the self-effacing barroom lament &quot;If You`re Looking for a Fool&quot; to the pointed &quot;You Might Be Lonely for a Reason,&quot; Wilder skewers his subjects with wit, reverb and a barrel-chested drawl. With his obvious love of British rock and Southern roadhouse, Wilder could be a kind of Tom Petty for the trailer set. &quot;You don`t have to be a good shot with a scattergun,&quot; Wilder sings. As the Nashville renegade (he calls his backup band the Nashvegans) likes to say, he and his group play both kinds of music, rock and roll. Echoes of 50s instrumental rock, British Invasion, garage grunge and psychedelia all surface throughout the album.\n\nWebb Wilder hasn't lost a step in the nine years since his last album release. ABOUT TIME has it all: Slambang rockers, twangin' laments, and cool cover tunes. And R.S. Field remains a master producer. This is definitely one all WW fans need to own, as well as anyone the least bit interested in rock and roll and Americana music. \n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nWebb Wilder: vocals, guitar \nGeorge &quot;The Tone Chaperone&quot; Bradfute: guitar \nTom Comet: Bass \nJimmy Lester: drums \n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1 Down on the Farm \n2 I Just Had to Laugh \n3 You Might Be Lonely for a Reason \n4 Miss Missy from Ol' Hong Kong \n5 If You're Looking for a Fool \n6 Tell the World \n7 Jimmy Reed is the King of Rock'n'Roll \n8 Scattergun \n9 Battle of the Bands \n10 Old Copper Penny \n11 Mary Lou \n12 Move It \n13 The Only One \n14 Little Boy Sad \n15 Scattergun (instrumental) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f5828d31947758cd46323776099b9eb07cbe69","amp;dn":"Webb+Wilder+-+About+Time++%5B2005%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f5828d31947758cd46323776099b9eb07cbe69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,245,130,141,49,148,119,88,205,70,50,55,118,9,155,158,176,124,190,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
