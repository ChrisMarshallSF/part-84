Authorizes No-Fly Zone\n- Bahrain Arrests Opposition Leaders, Clears Protest Encampment\n- Aristide Set for Haiti Return\n- House Passes Bill to De-Fund NPR\n- U.S. Denies Travel Visa to Afghan Activist\n- U.S. Develops Social Media Propaganda Software\n\n\nSpecial reports\n\n- &quot;Underestimating the Seriousness of the Problem&quot;: Experts Urge Japan to Raise Nuclear Alert and Evacuate Wider Area\n\nThe Japanese nuclear crisis worsens as Japanese authorities race to cool the overheating reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station. Earlier today, Japan raised the nuclear alert level at the crippled plant from a four to a five, on par with Three Mile Island. This decision has shocked many nuclear experts. &quot;Our experts think that it's a level 6.5 already and on the way to a 7, which was Chernobyl,&quot; says Philip White of the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center in Tokyo. We also speak with Dr. Ira Helfand of Physicians for Social Responsibility about the long-term health effects from radiation exposure from Fukushima.\n\n\n- &quot;Why Are We Playing Russian Roulette with the American People?&quot;: Longtime Nuclear Critic Ralph Nader Advocates Phasing Out Nuclear Power Industry\n\nFormer presidential candidate and longtime consumer advocate and nuclear critic Ralph Nader strongly advocates phasing out nuclear power in the United States by calling for public hearings on the status of every single nuclear power plant. &quot;What we see here is 110 or so operating nuclear plants in the U.S.-many of them aging, many of them infected with corrosion, faulty pipes, leaking pumps and combustible materials. Why are we playing Russian roulette with the American people for nuclear plants whose principal objective is simply to boil water and produce steam? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ This is institutional insanity and I urge the people in this country to wake up before they experience what is going on in northern Japan.&quot;\n\n\n- Gaddafi Declares Cease-fire After U.N. Security Council Backs No-Fly Zone in Libya\n\nInternational forces are threatening to launch airstrikes inside Libya following Thursday's vote by the United Nations Security Council to authorize a no-fly zone over Libya, and to undertake &quot;all necessary measures&quot; to protect civilians against leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi's forces. Earlier today, Libya's Foreign Minister announced an immediate end of military operations. We get analysis from UCLA Law Professor Asli Bali, who has written and commented extensively on the question of international intervention in Libya.\n\n\n- Defying U.S., Former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide Returns Home\n\nIn defiance of the Obama administration, former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is headed back to Haiti today for the first time since being ousted in a 2004 U.S.-backed coup. Hours ago, Aristide, his family, and a delegation of supporters boarded a plane in South Africa bound for Port-au-Prince. Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman is with the Aristides to document their journey home. She filed this report.\n\n\n- EXCLUSIVE: Aboard Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Airplane as Ex-Haitian President Returns From 7 Years In Exile\n\nIn his first public statements on his way home, former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide speaks to Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman, who is aboard the plane covering the historic return. &quot;I think that the Haitian people are very happy,&quot; Aristide says. &quot;Happy to know that we are on our way, happy to know that finally their dream will be fulfilled ... because they fought hard for democracy. They always wanted the return to happen and now it is happening.&quot;\n\n\n- Daniel Ellsberg on Bradley Manning's Solitary Confinement: &quot;The Conditions Clearly Violate the Constitution&quot;\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley resigned after describing the confinement of accused WikiLeaks whistleblower Army Private Bradley Manning as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;stupid.&quot; Manning is being held in &quot;maximum security confinement&quot; at the U.S. Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. We speak to Daniel Ellsberg, perhaps this country's most famous whistleblower and one of Manning's most public supporters. &quot;Manning] is being held essentially in solitary confinement for over nine months. Something that is likely to drive a person mad and that may be the intent of what is going on here,&quot; Ellsberg says.\n\n\n- Daniel Ellsberg Joins Peace Activists Risking Arrest at Protest Marking Iraq War Anniversary, Nader Calls for Impeachment of Obama\n\nRalph Nader and Daniel Ellsberg plan to participate in a major protest on Saturday in Washington, D.C., to mark the eight-year anniversary of the U.S-led invasion of Iraq. Ellsberg will risk arrest by participating in nonviolent civil disobedience actions by Veterans for Peace, among others, to protest the ongoing military occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;We're just slaughtering innocents,&quot; Nader says. &quot;Why don't we say what is on the minds of many legal experts? The Obama administration is committing war crimes. If Bush should have been impeached, Obama should be impeached.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911a39956be1337b5075405411215a4d95d6fc70","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+18+mar+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911a39956be1337b5075405411215a4d95d6fc70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,26,57,149,107,225,51,123,80,117,64,84,17,33,90,77,149,214,252,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
