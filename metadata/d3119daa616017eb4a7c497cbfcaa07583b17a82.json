It was released in Australia by Columbia Records on 13 October 2007 (see 2007 in music). The album was produced by band member James Ash ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who has also produced the band's previous albums and the lead singer Natalie Bassingthwaighte described the album as a step up, a bit older and more grown-up. Better in the Dark debuted in the top ten on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and is their second highest-selling album to date. The album has yielded three singles: &quot;Don't You Wanna Feel&quot;, &quot;I Never Liked You&quot; and &quot;What You're On&quot;. The album was never released in the U.K., although the album was released in China, with &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; replacing &quot;Better In The Dark&quot; and the word &quot;Traders&quot; being removed from the front cover.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Calling All Lovers&quot; (Jamie Appleby, Melinda Appleby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n   2. &quot;Don't You Wanna Feel&quot; (Appleby, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Steve Davis, Dougal Drummond) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n   3. &quot;I Never Liked You&quot; (Appleby, Appleby, Bassingthwaighte, Timothy Henwood) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n   4. &quot;Candy Coloured Lights&quot; (Appleby, Appleby, Bassingthwaighte) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n   5. &quot;Speak &amp; Destroy&quot; (Appleby, Appleby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n   6. &quot;Childlike&quot; (Appleby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n   7. &quot;On Your Way to the Disco&quot; (Appleby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n   8. &quot;8th Wonder of the World&quot; (Appleby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n   9. &quot;Better in the Dark&quot; (Appleby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n  10. &quot;What You're On&quot; (Appleby, Bassingthwaighte, Davis) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n  11. &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; (Appleby, Appleby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n  12. &quot;The Price We Pay&quot; (Appleby, Appleby, Appleby, Bassingthwaighte) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n  13.
