From the mean streets of Los Angeles to the desolate desert of New Mexico, Cruz must contend with a brutal Russian Boxer, three brash LAPD detectives, an aged billionaire looking for the Big Bang, and the billionaire's stunningly gorgeous wife. The solution to the mystery will cost ten lives, net $30 million and just might explain - well - everything.\nDirector: Tony Krantz\nGenres: Action, Mystery, Thriller\nLanguage:: English\nRelease Date: 2011(USA) \nSize: 391966789 bytes (373.81 MiB), duration: 01:33:40, avg.bitrate: 558 kb/s\nAudio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 640x272, 25.00 fps(r) (eng) [/quote]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a065afad7a610171d312549ed223126c93a5efc6","amp;dn":"The+Big+Bang+%282011%29+DVDRip+-+400MB+-+NightMare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a065afad7a610171d312549ed223126c93a5efc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,101,175,173,122,97,1,113,211,18,84,158,210,35,18,108,147,165,239,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
