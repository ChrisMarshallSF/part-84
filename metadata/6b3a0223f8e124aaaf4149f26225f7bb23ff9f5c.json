VINCE HAWKINS &amp; COMPANY SLAVE dig deep &amp; rip it hard @ this solid set of brain-damaging, get-down, retro-70s, six string mojo/riffage that will rock your good jam:house into the ground. Highly recommended to fans of Hendrix, Trower &amp; Frank Marino. \n\nThis new release by Vince Hawkins showcases his guitar talents. He obviously favors Hendrix and has a great tone/sound. He may sound like the great master, but is not a copy cat. His originals on this CD bring his own sound and songwriting to the forefront. If you are a fan of Jimi or heavy blues rock then this is for you.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tGrooveyard Records\t\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Gods Made Love\n02.Goin' To The South Side\n03.Three Kings\n04.It`s Time\n05.Peace On Earth\n06.Is Love\n07.Medusa's Dream\n08.Ashes In My Whiskey\n09.Big City Blues\n10.My Ship\n11.Cathouse\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b3a0223f8e124aaaf4149f26225f7bb23ff9f5c","amp;dn":"Vince+Hawkins+%26+Company+Slave+%282010%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b3a0223f8e124aaaf4149f26225f7bb23ff9f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,58,2,35,248,225,36,170,175,65,73,242,98,37,247,187,35,255,159,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
