Much is made of the fact that Dean's crossroad deal means that this is his last year on Earth before going to Hell. Lilith serves as a recurring villain throughout the season.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22107b03a6b0564eb7dcba038813ebd19f5d006e","amp;dn":"Supernatural+Season+3%5BDvDRip%5D%5BChris%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22107b03a6b0564eb7dcba038813ebd19f5d006e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,16,123,3,166,176,86,78,183,220,186,3,136,19,235,209,159,93,0,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
