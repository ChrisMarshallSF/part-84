This dvd contains six episodes, each covering a different type of engine - the imperial steam engine, the workhorse diesel, the exhilarating supercharger, the laid back v8, the noisy, smelly two-stroke, and the jet, the engine that went on to shrink the world. This is the highly-acclaimed channel 4 television series - a celebration of design, engineering and individual genius. If you want to see a man single-handedly remove the engine from a trabant, or toast marshmallows in the afterburner of a military jet aircraft, then this is the film for you - the guardian. I have a confession to make says robbie coltrane. I am a nosey bastard. I am incapable of walking past a piece of machinery without wanting to know all the details of its private life.\n\nPart 3. The Exhilarating Super Charger\nRobbie Coltrane continues his journey through 20th Century engineering by examining the engine that changed the course of motoring and military history: the supercharger. Travelling from the wilds of Scotland to the famous NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rburgring race track in Germany, Coltrane charts the development of the supercharger from its motor-racing origins to the vital role it played in the battle for air supermeacy in World War II and beyond.\n\nIMDB Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBFI Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 23 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 336 MB\nSource: DVDRip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a54e46567817277b649bfcc83c17f7306683fc6e","amp;dn":"Coltranes+Planes+and+Automobiles+3of6+Xvid+AC3+MVGroup+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a54e46567817277b649bfcc83c17f7306683fc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,78,70,86,120,23,39,123,100,155,252,200,60,23,247,48,102,131,252,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
