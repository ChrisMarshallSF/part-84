MeganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2010 release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a pop driven album which is a collaborative in style and musicianship that supersedes some of the charting talent of today. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a break out album for Megan, as each of the 12 songs highlight her talent as a singer and songwriter, with memorable and highly evocative vocals.
