Their situation becomes even more complicated when they befriend another dangerous couple. \n\n  IldikÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡czkevy  ...  Lili  \n  GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡bor Karalyos  ...  Pali  \n  MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Haumann  ...  Sanyi  \n  Gabriella HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡mori  ...  MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nika  \n\nSet at the end of 1999, this film is set in Miskolc, a city in northeastern Hungary, mainly with heavy industrial background.  Written and directed by Krisztin Deak, the film is based on the memoirs of Tunde Novak.  Depicted in flashforwards and flashbacks, the story of the lovers meeting, crimes, and eventual capture are revealed.  Neither of the leads is particularly likeable or revealed in depth but the story telling is skilled and intriguing, well photographed and edited, and ultimatley has poignance.\n\nThis film fared poorly in Hungary and the international festival circuit, drawing unfavorable comparisons to Natural Born Killers and the original classice Bonnie and Clyde.  However the film owes more structurally to Memento, Christopher Nolan's thriller told through a series of flashbacks.  It doesn't have the histrionic overacting and farce of Stone's film or the choreographed violence of the Beatty-Dunaway classic, but on its own terms it sucseeds as a well thought out faced paced action thriller that will leave you unchanged at the end.  Of particular ironic note is the fact that when they couple are first dubbed by the press as  'Bonnie and Clyde' they are unaware of who that couple were, and further they are referred to as 'BoniÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡jd' [Bonnieandclyde], a single archetypal unit and not as individuals.\n\nAlso includes Hungarian langage only trailer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:655a8621defb45cda2ed3889958975c7bdb0ba03","amp;dn":"A+miskolci+boniesklajd+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2004%5D+Krisztin+Deak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"655a8621defb45cda2ed3889958975c7bdb0ba03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,90,134,33,222,251,69,205,162,237,56,137,149,137,117,199,189,176,186,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
