In this episode,\n      Paul and Walter have trouble dealing with a customer's unlikely\n      order, Peter and Scott try out some unusual exercise machines at\n      the gym, and Jolly Boy John is once again 'for real' in another\n      video filmed in his bedroom. Joining the regulars are\n      12-year-old boys, Marky and Rosso who create mayhem in the\n      cinema, and self-proclaimed quality police team, McGregor and\n      Toshan inadvertently leave their own incriminating marks all\n      over a crime scene. Plus, the infuriated racehorse takes revenge\n      on a disappointed punter, the blossoming love affair between two\n      Kenny Rogers impersonators, and how a wee wardrobe terrified a\n      whole community.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
