Mini, ambient compositions punctuate the main tracks and an increasingly experimental tone is adopted as the album wears on. Boasts one of Ridgway's most haunting and moving songs, &quot;Right Through You,&quot; while &quot;Harry Truman&quot;, &quot;Roadblock&quot;, and the other-worldly &quot;Beyond Tomorrow&quot; make for a richly varied pallette that transports the listener from rural towns to the farthest reaches of the galaxy; from historical tragedies to lives in the balance; the album embodies them all. The delusionary underdog epic &quot;I Wanna Be A Boss&quot; is the albums sole single and ends up on morning drive time radio shows throughout the U.S. and in the U.K. Off on tour again.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing &amp; Personnel\n\n1.1   (Watch Your Step)  1:24\n \n1.2   Jack Talked (Like A Man On Fire)  2:55\n \n Bass, Backing Vocals - Joe Ramirez \n Drums, Timpani - Joseph Berardi \n Guitar - Mark Schulz \n Keyboards - Bernard Sauser-Hall \n Keyboards, Backing Vocals - Pietra Wexstun \n Vocals, Backing Vocals - Stan Ridgway\n \n2   I Wanna Be A Boss  4:52\n \n Backing Vocals - Beth Anderson , Evon Williams , John Batdorf , Larry Grennan , Pietra Wexstun \n Bass - David Sutton \n Drums - Joseph Berardi \n Guitar - Mark Schulz \n Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Keyboards - Stan Ridgway\n \n3.1   (Mouthfull Of Sand)  0:52\n \n3.2   The Roadblock  4:39\n \n Saxophone - Elmo Smith \n Vocals, Guitar, Keyboards, Harmonica - Stan Ridgway\n \n4   Snaketrain  3:53\n \n Steel Guitar [Lap] - Don Teshner \n Vocals, Guitar, Keyboards - Stan Ridgway\n \n5   Right Through You  3:45\n \n Backing Vocals - Pietra Wexstun \n Bass [Fretless] - David Sutton \n Piano - Jeff Boynton \n Vocals, Keyboards, Guitar - Stan Ridgway\n \n6   The Gumbo Man  3:34\n \n Bass - Joe Ramirez \n Drums, Percussion - Joseph Berardi \n Organ - Bernard Sauser-Hall \n Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Keyboards - Stan Ridgway\n \n7   Harry Truman  3:51\n \n Bass - Joe Ramirez \n Drums - Joseph Berardi \n Guitar - Mark Schulz \n Keyboards - Bernard Sauser-Hall , Pietra Wexstun \n Vocals, Acoustic Guitar - Stan Ridgway \n Written-By - Bill Noland\n \n8.1   (Venus Is Hell)  0:40\n \n8.2   Overlords  4:59\n \n Percussion - Joseph Berardi \n Percussion [Anvil] - Jim Hill \n Saxophone - Elmo Smith \n Vocals, Guitar, Keyboards - Stan Ridgway\n \n9.1   (O.K.?)  0:20\n \n9.2   Uba's House Of Fashions  4:16\n \n Bass, Backing Vocals - Joe Ramirez \n Drums - Joseph Berardi \n Guitar - Mark Schulz \n Keyboards - Bernard Sauser-Hall \n Keyboards, Backing Vocals - Pietra Wexstun \n Vocals, Backing Vocals - Stan Ridgway\n \n10.1   (Bad News At The Dynamite Ranch)  0:35\n \n10.2   Beyond Tomorrow  6:44\n \n Backing Vocals - Larry Grennan \n Drums, Percussion, Music By - Joseph Berardi \n Guitar, Music By - Mark Schulz \n Keyboards, Backing Vocals, Music By - Pietra Wexstun \n Keyboards, Music By - Bernard Sauser-Hall \n Music By - Joe Ramirez \n Vocals, Backing Vocals, Lyrics By - Stan Ridgway \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64dd9aa3f74c699304f784ded56690320758a6b6","amp;dn":"Stan+Ridgway+-+Partyball++%5B1991%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64dd9aa3f74c699304f784ded56690320758a6b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,221,154,163,247,76,105,147,4,247,132,222,213,102,144,50,7,88,166,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
