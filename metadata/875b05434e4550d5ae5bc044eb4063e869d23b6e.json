ISWA doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t just play heavy music that highlights on breakdowns and synth pop riffs, like most of the bands in their genre do. They are starting a unique and innovative style of writing and recording their music.\n\nISWA plays music with theme, and distinguishes themselves by writing songs based on a flow of emotion, rather than compiling their best riffs, hooks, and beats, and compressing them into three minute intervals. Every ISWA song sends a powerful message to the listener. Each song becomes deeper and deeper as it progresses, and entrances the audience.\n\nISWA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s mission is to expose all encompassing, deep music with both melody and ferocity, to the every person who is able to listen to them.\n\nIT STARTS WITH ALASKA is made up of 6 band members;\nJoey Friedlander [aged 21, Vocals],\nMalik Kweku [21, Vocals],\nNick Loiacono [17, Guitar, Programming],\nEvan Radkey [17, Guitar],\nEthan Wallace [14, Drums],\nRolan Negranza [19, Bass]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:875b05434e4550d5ae5bc044eb4063e869d23b6e","amp;dn":"It+Starts+With+Alaska-Promo+Songs+%5B2008%5D%2AEDIV%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"875b05434e4550d5ae5bc044eb4063e869d23b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,91,5,67,78,69,80,213,174,91,192,68,235,64,99,232,105,210,59,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
