Ray presented morning intelligence briefings at the White House for a number of presidents during nearly three decades in government. Upon retirement, McGovern was awarded the Intelligence Commendation Medal from Bush. He ultimately returned the award. Ray talks with Alex about George Bush's cancellation of a visit to Switzerland amid concerns that he could be arrested for allegedly authorizing the torture of prisoners and other war crimes.\n\nAlex also spends some time discussing the pole shift phenomenon and said that he will come back to the topic tomorrow. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.prisonplanet.com/pole-shift-threatens-to-cause-weather-chaos.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.prisonplanet.com/pole-shift-threatens-to-cause-weather-chaos.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
