Out of the blue, a Russian spy walks into their offices and offers a vital piece of information: the President of Russia will be assassinated during his forthcoming visit to New York City to attend the funeral of the recently deceased U.S. Vice President. The name of the assassin: Evelyn Salt. Concerned about the safety of her husband, who she cannot contact, she goes on the run. Winter refuses to accept that she is a mole or a double agent but her actions begin to raise doubts. Just who is Evelyn Salt and what is she planning? \n\n\n\nDirector:\nPhillip Noyce\nWriter:\nKurt Wimmer\nStars:\nAngelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor\n\n\n\n100 min  -  Action | Crime | Mystery \n\n\n\nRated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action. (Rated M in Australia)\n\n\n\nMy Comments:\n\nHi, this is my first torrent, and the reason I am uploading this torrent, is because I want make high quality movies available to torrent downloaders that are simple and easy to use.\n\nIn my past experience of being a torrent downloader (witch I still am) I began to realize that alot of movies come in file formats that are not compatible with some of the common players, such as Windows Media Player. So I decided that I would start uploading some movies in simple Mp4 or AVI format, which are compatible with Windows Media Player and many other players.\n\n(I will also never upload Cams, only DVD-rips.)\n\nThis movie is a DVD-rip (meaning I used a program to copy the movie from the disc onto my hard drive) and the definition is great.\nPlease comment and give me some feedback on weather you liked this torrent or not and how I can change it to make it better next time, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.\n\nBy the way, I will be uploading some more movies soon, enjoy.\n\n\n-TheOrganicDJ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf0eb20caf4809a4043307062cfb63b23bc88bc9","amp;dn":"Salt+%282010%29+HD+DVDrip+TheOrganicDJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf0eb20caf4809a4043307062cfb63b23bc88bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,14,178,12,175,72,9,164,4,51,7,6,44,251,99,178,59,200,139,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
