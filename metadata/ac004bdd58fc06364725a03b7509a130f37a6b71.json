Born within four days of each other in April 1889, Chaplin and Hitler became, respectively, the most-loved and most-hated men of their time. The two lives intersected when Chaplin made The Great Dictator (1940), a satire of Hitler and his Nazi empire. &quot;Here was this huge artist standing up against this gargantuan monster,&quot; film critic Stanley Kauffmann says in the documentary. \n\nAmong others interviewed are Chaplin' s son, Sydney Chaplin; politician/historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.; film directors Bernard Vorhaus and Sidney Lumet; and caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, who served as publicity artist for The Great Dictator. The documentary includes never-before-seen color film shot by Chaplin's brother, Sydney, during the making of The Great Dictator and recently discovered at the Chaplin villa in Switzerland.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac004bdd58fc06364725a03b7509a130f37a6b71","amp;dn":"The+Tramp+and+the+Dictator+%28VHS%29+%28TV%29+%5B2002%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac004bdd58fc06364725a03b7509a130f37a6b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,0,75,221,88,252,6,54,71,37,160,59,117,9,161,48,243,122,107,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
