The miniature view in the user interface allows you to get an overview of your photo collection or rather photos in a folder. Of course, you can also sort your photos according to date and time when the photo was taken (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcalendar overviewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) or you can filter the photos according to different criteria, e.g. only .jpg files, not older than two month or tagged with a certain term.\n\nNot only pictures, but also audio and video collections are neatly displayed. Photos can be grouped differently or compiled in a virtual album for further editing. Batch processing allows you to select several pictures for editing, e.g. convert them into a different format.\n\nThe editing and quick-fix modes in Ashampoo Photo Commander 9 are designed clearly and intuitively so that you can give free rein to your creativity and experiment with effects and functions. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to rotate pictures, adjust horizontal nonalignment, crop images, remove red eyes and lots more. With just a click photos can be optimized or changed using effects, e.g. inversion, pixelization or outlining of contours.\n\nAshampoo Photo Commander 9 also offers you several cool features to present your photos. Create for example a slideshow or an HTML album in order to show your photos to family and friends. Collages as well as greeting cards or calendars are easily produced in next to no time.\n\nMoreover, Ashampoo Photo Commander 9 enables you to make screenshots, scan images as well as print photos, send them by e-mail or burn them on a disc.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Ashampoo Photo Commander&quot;:\n\n3D hardware acceleration:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The program now automatically uses the 3D processor in your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s video card to achieve a performance boost. If you have a 3D video card this significantly speeds up photo viewing and transition effects for smoother resizing and zooming, with additional smoothing for less ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œjaggyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ images at high magnifications.\n\nNew, more efficient media database:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The new automatic database that manages your media files is now both faster and more efficient, automatically updating when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re uploading your media files on your PC.
