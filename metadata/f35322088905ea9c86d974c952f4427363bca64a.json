There, he collaborated with Jackson Browne, who during 1976 would produce and promote Zevon's self-titled major-company debut. Contributors to this album included Nicks, Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, members of the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Bonnie Raitt. Ronstadt elected to record many of his songs, including &quot;Hasten Down the Wind,&quot; &quot;Carmelita,&quot; &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me,&quot; and &quot;Mohammed's Radio.&quot; Zevon's first tour during 1977 included guest appearances in the middle of Jackson Browne concerts, one of which is documented on a widely circulated bootleg recording of a Dutch radio program under the title The Offender meets the Pretender.\n\nThough a much darker and more ironic songwriter than Browne and other leading figures of the era's L.A.-based singer-songwriter movement, Zevon shared with his 1970s L.A. peers a grounding in earlier folk and country influences and a commitment to a writerly style of songcraft with roots in the work of artists like Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Though only a modest commercial success, the Browne-produced Warren Zevon (1976) would later be termed a masterpiece in the first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide and is cited in the book's most recently revised (November 2004) edition as Zevon's most realized work. Representative tracks include the junkie's lament &quot;Carmelita,&quot; the Copland-esque outlaw ballad &quot;Frank and Jesse James,&quot; &quot;The French Inhaler,&quot; a scathing insider's look at life and lust in the L.A. music business and &quot;Desperadoes Under the Eaves,&quot; a chronicle of Zevon's increasing alcoholism. It was during this period that Zevon's excessive vodka comsumption earned him the nickname &quot;F. Scott Fitzevon,&quot; a reference to the American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose early, alcohol-related death Zevon seemed bent on repeating.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs composed by Warren Zevon\n\nSide A:\n&quot;Frank and Jesse James&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n&quot;Mama Couldn't Be Persuaded&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n&quot;Backs Turned Looking Down the Path&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n&quot;Hasten Down the Wind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n&quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n&quot;The French Inhaler&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n\nSide B:\n&quot;Mohammed's Radio&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n&quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n&quot;Carmelita&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n&quot;Join Me in L.A.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n&quot;Desperados Under the Eaves&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n\nPersonnel\nWarren Zevon - harmonica, piano, rhythm guitar, string arrangements, vocals\nJackson Browne - harmony vocals on tracks 2, 3 &amp; 11, piano on track 10, slide guitar on track 3\nLindsey Buckingham - guitar on track 3, harmony vocals on tracks 5 &amp; 7\nRosemary Butler - harmony vocals on track 10\nJorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n - harmony vocals on tracks 8 &amp; 11\nMarty David - bass on track 3\nNed Doheny - guitar on track 10\nPhil Everly - harmony vocals on tracks 1 &amp; 4\nGlenn Frey - rhythm guitar on track 9, harmony vocals on tracks 6 &amp; 9\nBob Glaub - bass on tracks 1, 2, 4 - 7 &amp; 9 - 11\nDon Henley - harmony vocals on track 6\nBilly Hinsche - harmony vocals on track 11\nBobby Keys - saxophone on tracks 5, 7 &amp; 10\nDavid Lindley - banjo on track 1, fiddle on tracks 1, 2 &amp; 5, slide guitar on tracks 4 &amp; 7, guitar on track 9\nGary Mallaber - drums on tracks 3 &amp; 8\nRoy Marinell - bass on track 8\nStevie Nicks - vocals on track 7\nBonnie Raitt - harmony vocals on track 10\nFritz Richmond - jug on track 8\nSid Sharp - strings on tracks 4, 6 &amp; 11\nJ.D.
