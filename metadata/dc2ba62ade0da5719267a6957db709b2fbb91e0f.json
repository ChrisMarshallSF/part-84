Even listening to them via the tunes on their Myspace page is punishing with their distorted grooves, pounding drums and low-ended, bass driven Doom - Laden arrangements. \nThey also have a EP out on Raig Records called &quot;Moth&quot; which is a masterpiece of sonic self-indulgence so i can only imagine what their live shows must be like. Sounding like Electric Wizard and Sons Of Otis's love-child, this band is dirty, raw example of pushing the boundaries of extreme riff-rock.\nFans of early 70's rock, doom and drones of varying degrees of distortion and pitch, delay drenched guitar solos, their goal is to write songs that can be both tight and heavy and also descend into more improvised psychedelic rock territory.\n\nCurrent lineup\nDavid Lynch - Guitar/Vocals \nCharles Howes - Drums\nNeal Wilson - Bass\n\nGenre = Psychedelic Stoner / Doom\nFormat = mp3\nBitrate = 320 kbps\nFile Size = 152.23 MB\n\nTracklist\n1. Infinity\t\t\n2. The Fickle Whims of the Almighty\t\t\n3. Space Wizard\t\t\n4. Plague Bearer\t\t\n5. The Hierophant\t\t\n6. Moth\t\t\n7. Robbie's Song\t\t\n8.
