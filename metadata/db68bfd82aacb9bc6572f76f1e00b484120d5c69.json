In 2010, 140 million pounds will be spent to win the battle for the hearts and minds of young Muslims, but the policy risks alienating many in Britain's Muslim communities. With unique access to a man who came face to face with Al-Qa'idah and the inside story of how police managed to thwart would-be suicide bombers, the programme examines the biggest single threat to national security.\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 467 MiB\nDuration                         : 58mn 32s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 115 Kbps\n\nShare and share alike!
