The current line-up features long-time lead guitarist Kirk Hammett (who joined the band in 1983) and bassist Robert Trujillo (a member since 2003) alongside Hetfield and Ulrich. Notable previous members of the band include former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine (who later went on to found the band Megadeth) and former bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted. The band also had a long collaboration with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of the bands albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.\n\nMetallica's early releases included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed the band as one of the founding &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax.[1] The band earned a growing fan-base in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with its third album Master of Puppets (1986) described as one of the most influential and &quot;heavy&quot; thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with their eponymous fifth album (also known as The Black Album), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience.\n\nIn 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without any band member's consent.[2] A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the &quot;steel-sounding&quot; snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time.\n\n\nTracks:\n\nThe Ecstasy Of Gold\nThat Was Just Your Life\nThe End Of The Line\nRide The Lightning\nThe Memory Remains\nOne\nBroken, Beat And Scarred\nLeper Messiah\nSad But True\nNo Leaf Clover\nSuicide and Redemption\nThe Day That Never Comes\nMaster Of Puppets\nDyers Eve\nNothing Else Matters\nEnter Sandman\nLast Caress\nPhantom Lord\nSeek and Destroy\n\n\n\n\n\nDati\n\nGeneral\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 7.96 GiB\nDuration : 2h 17mn\nOverall bit rate : 8 312 Kbps\nWriting library : libebml v0.7.9 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nFormat : AVC\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4901202e2109057d6778&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nDuration : 2h 17mn\nBit rate : 6 799 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nLanguage : English\n\nAudio\nFormat : DTS\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 1 510 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7a4f46bdfa15423d6cdb4b2f8e7d387e9807178","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Fan+can+6+%5BBDrip+x264+720p+Eng+DTS%5D+Live+Copenaghen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7a4f46bdfa15423d6cdb4b2f8e7d387e9807178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,164,244,107,223,161,84,35,214,205,180,178,248,231,211,135,233,128,113,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
