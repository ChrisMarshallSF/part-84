In those days, no matter how many songs were recorded at a session, record producers would ration us to only ten to twelve songs per album and discard the rest. Few record producers were more parsimonious than Norman Grantz. I have just ripped one of Ella's albums on Pablo and it contains a miserly nine songs. The songs on this album are not 'alternate takes' or in any way 'seconds', just songs that were deemed surplus to the 'ration'.\n\nGregg Field, now a partner at the Concord Music Group and co-producer of this album, is also one of the world's top drummers. He was a member of the Count Basie Orchestra in the early eighties and part of Ella's permanent trio. He knew that a lot of Ella's recordings on Pablo were unreleased, he played on many, so he set about finding them.\n\nThe result is this themed 'Love Song' album (which suggests that he found a lot more Pablo tracks) released in 2007 to celebrate what would have been Ella's 90th birthday.\n\nElla with:\n\nCount Basie &amp; His Orchestra - tracks 1 &amp; 10.\nLondon Symphony Orchestra - track 2.\nLondon Symphony Orchestra &amp; Joe Pass - tracks 4 &amp; 8.\nLondon Symphony Orchestra &amp; Scott Hamilton - track 6.\nJoe Pass - track 7.\nAndre Previn &amp; Niels-Henning Orsted Pederson - track 9.\nElla's Trio (Michael Lang: Piano, Gregg Field: Drums, Chuck Berghofer: Bass) Tracks 3 &amp; 5.\n\n 01 Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone \n 02 Cry Me A River \n 03 You Turned the Tables on Me  \n 04 I've Got the World On a String    \n 05 Witchcraft  \n 06 My Old Flame    \n 07 The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)  \n 08 Take Love Easy \n 09 Our Love Is Here To Stay    \n 10 Some Other Spring \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7892757814309eb67a22b24b61ae926fa30b10a1","amp;dn":"Ella+Fitzgerald+-+Love+Letters+From+Ella+%282007+Remaster%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7892757814309eb67a22b24b61ae926fa30b10a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,146,117,120,20,48,158,182,122,34,178,75,97,174,146,111,163,11,16,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
