E. Lawrence who revealed Frederic Manning as the author of this unique novel. All the horrors of trench warfare are here, as experienced by Manning himself on the Somme and Ancre fronts in 1916. Despite the bloodbath, friendships are strong as the men endure both the constant threat of death and the senseless bureaucracy of their own army. Private Bourne has rejected the opportunity to enlist as an officer preferring to stay with the ordinary soldiers in the ranks. Unable to conceal his obvious leadership qualities he is recommended for a commission, which he reluctantly agrees to. His one condition before leaving for officer training in England, is that he be allowed to take part in the next big attack. Everyday realities of trench warfare are brought to life, in this first ever audio edition of this classic novel.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:898ec374e22f3109721e77404d37909594f6f248","amp;dn":"HPW-Bookpodz+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"898ec374e22f3109721e77404d37909594f6f248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,142,195,116,226,47,49,9,114,30,119,64,77,55,144,149,148,246,242,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
