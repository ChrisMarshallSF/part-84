They go to the Turkish baths within an ancient fortress to meet their dealer, but end up trapped there and mercilessly killed one by one by a mysterious murderer clad in black leather. It all seems to have some connection with the strange and very rare illness T. T. Syndrome, but will they solve the mystery before theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve all gone down the drain? With T. T. SYNDROME, Director Dejan Zecevic creates an effective blend of classic slasher-movie shocks and Argento-style whodunit (note close-up fetishism for gloves, door handles and various sharp weaponry, plus the typical giallo motifs of a strong mother figure, childhood trauma and a haunting nursery rhyme). Relentless claustrophobia and tension in an inspired setting, at their most effective, resemble the highlights of early John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper films, while the vivid flashes of gore invoke the spirit of vintage Lucio Fulci.\n\n  Nikola Djuricko  ...

SYNDROME can stand proudly next to most American indie efforts. Zecevic makes a most inventive use of his limited setting, the decrepit Turkish bath and public toilet. Through his directorial skill he creates a palpable menace within such a banal setting which, by the conclusion in the fortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s catacombs, attains an almost mythical quality. The filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s technical side is quite competent, and the same can be said for the acting ensemble, including a few veterans from VARIOLA VERA. T. T. SYNDROME became a cult film in Serbia and even managed to get into several international genre festivals. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the first Serbian horror film that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel obliged to justify itself with elements of more respectable genres. It does not imply a political allegoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½although placing (and killing off) its youthful cast entirely in a public toilet might have been a statement about the dashed hopes of post-Milosevic Serbia, after all! But above everything else, the movie uses motifs and style of the slasher film, plain and simple, to scare its audience. It is a horror fanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brainchild made first and foremost for other horror fans.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5306de18fb2b9aee9ea0006e567497726929eef7","amp;dn":"T.T.+Sindrom+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2002%5D+Dejan+Zecevic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5306de18fb2b9aee9ea0006e567497726929eef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,6,222,24,251,43,154,238,158,160,0,110,86,116,151,114,105,41,238,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
