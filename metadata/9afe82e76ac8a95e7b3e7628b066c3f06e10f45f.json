Matt's been having an affair with Ann Merai Harrison, a woman who's separated from her husband Chris and who says that she has cancer. When her doctor tells her of a new treatment that's expensive, Matt gives her the nearly half a million dollars that he seized from some drug dealers. When she turns up dead evidence points to Whitlock. He tries to figure out what's going on but apparently it appears he's been set up. So he has to try and find the money especially now that the Feds are asking for it before the evidence exposes him.\n\nGeneral:\n\nComplete name                    : Out Of Time\\Out Of Time.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.47 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 080 Kbps\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nBit rate                         : 1 621 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.296\nStream size                      : 1.14 GiB (78%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 324 MiB (22%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 32 ms (0.80 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 256 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9afe82e76ac8a95e7b3e7628b066c3f06e10f45f","amp;dn":"Out+Of+Time+2003+DVDrip+English+Klam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9afe82e76ac8a95e7b3e7628b066c3f06e10f45f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,254,130,231,106,200,169,94,123,62,118,40,176,102,195,240,110,16,244,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
