After the cash-strapped dad takes a job moonlighting for a drug company, however, Jack's suspicions about his favorite male nurse come roaring back. When Greg and Pam's entire clan-including Pam's lovelorn ex, Kevin (Owen Wilson)-descends for the twins' birthday party, Greg must prove to the skeptical Jack that he's fully capable as the man of the house. But with all the misunderstandings, spying and covert missions, will Greg pass Jack's final test and become the family's next patriarch...or will the circle of trust be broken for good?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bb51c5f3b4b5ce25741207f6699590679d3a0c4","amp;dn":"Little+Fockers+%5B2010%5D+DVDRip.iPod.iPhone.Mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bb51c5f3b4b5ce25741207f6699590679d3a0c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,181,28,95,59,75,92,226,87,65,32,127,102,153,89,6,121,211,160,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
