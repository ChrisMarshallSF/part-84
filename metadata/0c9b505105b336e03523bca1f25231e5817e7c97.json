The so-called economic recovery is an illusion, and the underlying elements of the financial structure are continuing to deteriorate, with more mortgage foreclosures coming in 2011-12, he said. We'll continue to see declining prices in housing, and the commercial real estate sector will also slide downward, with retail malls failing in the 2011-12 period, he predicted.\n\nThe bull market for precious metals is just getting started, and though there'll be some corrections, it will continue rising for the next decade, he declared. He recommended investing in gold and silver coins, as well as bullion, and quality mining stocks. Meyer also advised making investments with utility companies, and the energy market (diversifying with 1/3 international oil companies, 1/3 oil service stocks, and 1/3 in the natural gas sector).\n\nAngelic Communications\n\nDuring the third hour, Tom Lumbrazo talked about his interactions with angels and spirit guides, which began after an angelic warning saved his life during a car accident. Having taken up painting after this incident, he noted that &quot;art and music are the keys to communication with the angels.&quot; He also discussed his ability to discern messages and figures in cloud formations, which he likened to crop circles.\n\nThe last hour of the show featured Open Lines.\n\nNews segment guests: John Hogue, Richard C.
