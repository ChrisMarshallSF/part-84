The media revere the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ movement, the anti-war movement, politicians and activists like Erin Brockovich.\n\nThe media are party clueless, and apparently, so am I.\n\nDid you know the Founders fought against dancing, interracial mixing and masturbation?\n\nDid you know Martin Luther King called rock 'n' roll evil and degraded black music?\n\nDid you know Erin BrockovichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lawyer buddies made $100,000,000 suing PG&amp;E?  The movie was wonderful, and Julia Roberts deserves her Oscar.  But the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtrueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ story behind it is largely lawyer deceit.  The California Cancer Registry analyzed cancer rates in the area and found no elevation in the level of cancer. But the power company paid the lawyers millions to go away, and Californians pay the cost in their electric bills. So why are the lawyers heroes?\n\nAnd why are politicians heroes?  For my closing segment tonight, I steal the following idea from one of my heroes, former Reason Editor Virginia Postrel.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://reason.com/archives/1996/06/01/false-diagnosis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://reason.com/archives/1996/06/01/false-diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1cda0934fa44a420b5a9f80bbbf2ceeef4f2dcb","amp;dn":"20110310-Stossel-%5BAmericas+Heros...not%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1cda0934fa44a420b5a9f80bbbf2ceeef4f2dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,205,160,147,79,164,74,66,11,90,159,128,187,191,44,238,239,79,45,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
