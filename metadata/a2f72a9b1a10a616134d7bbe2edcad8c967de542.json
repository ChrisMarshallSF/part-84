The show continued the 1960s Beat-Club under a new name, and in turn was replaced by Extratour.\n\nA normal episode of Musikladen usually featured several live performances by guest musicians, and ran around 45 minutes. Some episodes were longer, and a few were shorter. In the 1980s, music videos were shown along with live performances.\n\n&quot;New Song&quot; is the debut single by musician Howard Jones, released in September 1983. The song, from the album Human's Lib, reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. The single spent 20 weeks on the Top 75. In the US, &quot;New Song&quot; peaked at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, although it was not released there until early 1984.\n\n&quot;New Song&quot; itself was later re-recorded for The 12&quot; Album, in a version titled &quot;New Song (New Version)&quot;. This featured a lot of multi-layered piano, in contrast to the austere synthesizer sound of the original 7&quot; and 12&quot; versions.\n\nThe song can be heard in the 1984 film Supergirl.\n\nHoward Jones (born John Howard Jones, 23 February 1955, Southampton, Hampshire, England) is a Welsh musician. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums, &quot;Jones is an accomplished singer-songwriter who was a regular chart visitor in the mid 1980s with his brand of synthpop. Jones, who was equally popular in the U.S., appeared at Live Aid&quot;. \n\nAllmusic journalist, Stephen Thomas Erlewine adds, &quot;Jones was one of the defining figures of mid 1980s synthpop. His music merged the technology intensive sound of new wave with the cheery optimism of hippies and late 1960s pop. Jones racked up a string of hits in the mid and late 1980s, before he retreated into being a cult figure in the 1990s&quot;.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Song_(Howard_Jones_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Song_(Howard_Jones_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LAdgIAadO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LAdgIAadO&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9585kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:50\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \n\nIt's 100% free to download and use.
