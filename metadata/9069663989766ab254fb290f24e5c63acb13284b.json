Chev Chelios (Statham) was one of the most skilled assassins in the West Coast crime syndicate. When he hung up his guns in the middle of a job to run off with his new girlfriend Eve (Smart), however, the man who was once the hunter now becomes the hunted. Awakened from his slumber by a telephone call informing him of his precarious situation, Chelios soon discovers that the only way to save Eve from certain death at the hands of his nemesis is to stay two steps ahead of his killers, keep his heart-rate high enough to stay alive, and blast through the streets of Los Angeles in search of an antidote. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 27 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9069663989766ab254fb290f24e5c63acb13284b","amp;dn":"Crank%282006%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9069663989766ab254fb290f24e5c63acb13284b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,105,102,57,137,118,106,178,84,251,41,15,36,229,198,58,203,19,40,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
