Introduction\n---------------\nWarcraft 2 Combat Edition is modification of well-known game Warcraft II Battle.net Edition.\nA goal of modification is maximal decrease game size and allow to use it without compact disc, thus making the game accessible to most people.\nAt the same time general game elemets were saved:\n- multiplayer game, especially on battle.net server of russian war2 community\n- single game vs computer players\n- game appearance and general sounds\n\nBut some elements were removed from the game:\n- music\n- campaigns and some maps\n- map editor\n- sound editor\n- video staff\n- campaign speech\n- heroes voices\n- units annoy voice\n\nNew in version 3.04:\n- some small fixes: gateways, interface, intro and banner pictures, AIE maps\n\n1. Installation\n---------------\nJust execute installation exe-file and follow installation wizard\nTo do it you need not administrative privileges.\nYou can select some components during installation process. Default is recommended, but you can select/deselect some components manually:\n- New AI for ground attack by zzzKOTzzz\nImproved ground attack. It becomes very difficult to win even 2 computer opponents with ground attack.\nClassic AI for ground attack will be unavailable if you select this.\n\n- Rewrite gateway list\nIt will write official bnet and 2 war2.ru gateways to your system. It won\\'t be removed if you decide to uninstall war2combat.\nIt will remove any other gateways from your list if you install it.\nIf you install war2 for the first time you needn\\'t use this, gateways will be updated automatically during the first start.\nIt\\'s recommended to use it only if you haven\\'t all gateways you need to play.\n\n- War2Ppatcher 5.0 and WPpatch14.88\nUtilities for tweaking war2 (Described below).\nI can\\'t find why you needn\\'t install them. These are very small utilities which can help you to do some tweaks with war2.\nThese utilities applies only to executing process, not to exe-file, and you can just start war2 without them if you want.\n\nIf you want to change some installation components you can just start installation process once more to the same folder. Uninstallation will remove all your installations.\n\n2. Starting\n-----------\nAfter you installing war2combat you have program group with some shortcuts and an icon on desktop (optionally).\n\nWar2Combat link on desktop is actually a link to \\&quot;War2Launcher.bat\\&quot; or WPpatch.exe or War2noCDloader.exe - it\\'s small loader to start it without CD.\n\nWar2Combat loader starts war2 with all features listed in section \\&quot;WP patch 1.488\\&quot;\nActivated War2Combat starts war2 with all features listed in section \\&quot;Warcraft 2 Process patcher\\&quot; except \\&quot;First TH\\&quot;\n\nYou can always check activated features (or deactivate them) starting \\&quot;Warcraft 2 Process patcher\\&quot;\nYou can also select features for War2Ppatcher manually, editing \\&quot;War2Launcher.bat\\&quot; in your game directory (section \\&quot;Warcraft 2 Process patcher\\&quot;)\n\n\n3. Uninstallation\n-----------------\nUninstallation will remove any files created by installation but not any saved games or your maps and other files you put there later.\nUninstallation also leave all registry keys untouched. All registry keys created by war2combat are in \\&quot;HCKU\\\\Software\\\\Battle.net\\&quot; and \\&quot;HCKU\\\\Software\\\\Blizzard Entertainment\\&quot;.\n\n\n4. Additional features\n----------------------\n- After you install war2combat you can use it as portable - you can start it on any other computer from your flash drive, or from compact disc or even via neighbourhood.\nYou need only to activate \\&quot;War2noCD.reg\\&quot; once on any new computer. To start war2 you just need to start War2noCDloader.exe, and no administrative privileges need to do it.\n\n- war2combat includes some maps:\nclassic maps, and ladder maps: standard ladder map pack as well as ladder versions of some other maps (look at your maps\\\\ladder directory)\nyou also can play Iron Man Ladder but it\\'s random map selected only from standard ladder list.\n\n- You can play Iron Man Ladder games with rating 1100 or higher that could be useful for tournaments (section \\&quot;Warcraft 2 Process patcher\\&quot;)\nYou can also select any resources playing Iron Man.\n\n- This version is compatible with War2InSight, WarLatency, Warvideo and other tools.\n\n- You can play on official bnet servers using war2combat.\nYou should start war2 via War2noCDloader.exe, not War2Ppatcher or WP patch.\nAfter starting war2 and before joining bnet you should start War2noCDunloader.exe.\nAfter joining bnet you can start any features by War2Ppatcher.\nBe sure you set correct CD-key. Default CD-key of war2combat is disabled of course.\n\n=================================================================\nAIE - AI Extended, version 3.03\n-------------------------------\nNew AI by Rotonda makes the computer players better. AI can \\&quot;select\\&quot; different strategies for different maps.\nNew AI can be used ONLY on maps from \\&quot;aie\\&quot; directory. AI would be standard on usual maps.\n\nMaps in Scenarios and Scenarios_Sea directories require game type \\&quot;Use Map Settings\\&quot; and default resources.\nAll the maps have been tested, and you can win on all maps although it can be difficult.\n\n=================================================================\nWarcraft 2 Process patcher\n--------------------------\nThis program allows you to use some useful features for warcraft 2, but it is not hack!\nTo use it you can enable any features any time after you start your Warcaft II BNE\n\nYou can enable or disable any features.\nYou can use either graphic interface or command prompt.\n\nToday last version of program has 6 features:\n\n1. Warlatency.\nIt do the same as the same well-known utility, but I hope it\\'s more comfortable to use it.\n\n2. First TH\nClassic game returns!\nIf you ever played war2 via null-modem or IPX you can remember that you could build any structures (barracks, farm etc) without first TH.\nThis feature allows you to do it at battle.net.\nBuilding of first TH also takes more time, so you can build barrack or farm faster than your opponent builds TH.\nAttention! It\\'s not hack!\nIf hacker will try to play with this feature activated when others don\\'t, synchronization will be lost and hacker will be dropped.\nAll players must activate this feature to use it.\n\n3. Resource bug\nWarcraft II BNE has a bug:\n\nWhen hosting a game on High resources you must click through low and high again for it to work or it will stay on default. (Game glitch)\n\n\nThis feature can fix this bug same as ZWarLat.\nWarning! this bug returns if you want to play Iron Man Ladder, but it can be fixed by next features.\n\n4. Even Faster speed for Ladder/Iron Man Ladder\nBy default Ladder/Iron speed is fixed at faster.\nIf you don\\'t like faster you can use this feature to use even faster speed.\nYou need not it if you want only to join ef ladder or iron game.\n\n5. Iron Man Ladder resources\nBy default resources for Iron Man Ladder are low and you can\\'t change it.\nThis unlocks any type of resources for Iron Man ladder.\nIf you use resource bug fix and don\\'t use this feature resource bug is active for ironman. But if you activate this, resource bug for ironman becoming inactive.\n\n6. Iron Man Ladder threshold lowering\nBy default you can play Iron Man games if your ladder rating not less than 1200. This feature allows you to play Iron Man Ladder if your rating not less than 1100.\n\n\nHow to use it:\nIf you just double-click at program\\'s icon, a window will appear.\nHowever if you start this program from command prompt (or .bat file) using some parameters, some actions will be done automatically.\n\nYou even can tell program to wait war2 being started (\\&quot;-w\\&quot;). Then program will be started, but no windows will appear, and it will be running until you start war2 or close program from task manager.\n\nYou can use \\&quot;-h\\&quot; to see these parameters.\nHere they are:\n-a activate WarLatency\n-d deactivate WarLatency\n-b set first TH as War2 BNE\n-c set first TH as War2 Classic\n-f fix resource bug\n-u unfix resource bug\n-se set speed in iron/ladder to Even Faster\n-sf set speed in iron/ladder to Faster\n-ir unlock resources in iron\n-iR lock resources in iron\n-i1100 set ironman ladder threshold to 1100\n-i1200 set ironman ladder threshold to 1200\n-w wait until War2 is started\n-h see this usage screen\n\nAs you see, any features can be activated by both methods - command prompt and graphics window.\n\nWarcraft II BNE.bat :\nI have icon for war2 on my desktop. It\\'s shortcut to .bat-file listed below:\n------------------- startwar2.bat\nstart war2ppatcher.exe -a -f -se -ir -i1100 -w\n\\&quot;Warcraft II BNE.exe\\&quot;\n------------------- end\n\nevery time I start warcraft 2 I\\'m sure to have:\nactivated WarLatency, fixed resource bug, even faster ladder, all resources for iron.\n\nI hope, my utility will be useful for you.\nLet\\'s try!\n\n=================================================================\nWP patch 1.488\n--------------\nfor Warcraft II BNE 2.02\n\nCreated by zzzKOTzzz and il\n\nEmail:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e49e9e9e8f8b909e9e9ea4888d9790ca9691&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nInstruction:\nCopy file \\&quot;WPpatch.exe\\&quot; to your Warcraft II BNE directory.\nRun \\&quot;WPpatch.exe\\&quot;.
