He cuts up Philip Glass songs and then lays down the vocals from well-known hip hop tracks. The results are quite unique.\n\nShortly after its release in 2006, he was forced to take this album off the market due to copyright issues. But we don't take kindly to those around here, now do we! Hurrah!\n\n* * *\n\nHere are the tracks (all are Mp3 at 160 kbps):\n\n1. Einstein on The Beast\nPhilip Glass (various pieces from Einstein on The Beach)\nThe Beastie Boys (Pass The Mic)\n\n2. For The Glasty\nPhilip Glass (Dance V)\nQ-Tip and Busta Rhymes (For The Nasty)\n\n3. How Many Whores?\nPhilip Glass and Foday Muso Susa (Warda's Whorehouse)\nThe Fugees (How many Mics?)\n\n4.
