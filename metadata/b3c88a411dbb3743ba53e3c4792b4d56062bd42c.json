Leaving, TX bristles with raw emotional energy.&quot; - Raleigh Independent &quot;Compared favorably to Drive By Truckers, Reckless Kelly, and Steve Earle... And not without good cause.&quot; - Maverick Magazine &quot;One of the strongest contenders to emerge on the alt.country scene in years.&quot; - Ontap Magazine Gripping vocals, intelligent lyrics, and songs filled with memorable hooks are what you will find with the LEAVING, TX. This original alt.country outfit delivers a clever blend of cutting edge twang-rock mixed with a healthy dose of raw, whiskey-soaked country. The band is driven by songwriter Chris Patterson's rugged, in your face vocal style, ripping telecasters and sweet pedal steel... All anchored by a tight, driving rhythm section. This powerful group of musicians allow Patterson's songs to really shine.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/06/2743/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/06/2743/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c88a411dbb3743ba53e3c4792b4d56062bd42c","amp;dn":"Leaving%2C+TX...Late+Gettin%5C%27+Started%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c88a411dbb3743ba53e3c4792b4d56062bd42c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,200,138,65,29,187,55,67,186,83,227,196,121,43,77,86,6,43,212,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
