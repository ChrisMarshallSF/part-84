I have edited out the music played during the commercial breaks.\n\nNotes about each hour.  Please remember I haven't listened to the whole show yet myself:\n\n\nHour 1 ends oddly.  This is how I received it (captured).  I'm capping the rebroadcast of Hr1 as I type this.  If it ends normally I will upload a new Hr 1 (possibly just the end?)... if it ends the same I will post a comment.\n\nHour 2 has a rare moment of inside baseball.  During one of the breaks they were playing a sound clip.  I left that in.\n\nHour 3 has two notes.  One is the first commercial I left it all in due to the oddness of it.  The ironic second note is that Glenn did a recorded commercial that was web broadcasted.  I left that one in too just for the fun of it.  :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c46508f7d60b87fcd1443c573ed49ba90a8f0646","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+2011-03-16+%28Radio+Web+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c46508f7d60b87fcd1443c573ed49ba90a8f0646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,101,8,247,214,11,135,252,209,68,60,87,62,212,155,169,10,143,6,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
