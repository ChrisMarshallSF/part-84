Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many.\n\nWith crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene shows how a range of different &quot;multiverse&quot; proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of mathematics.\n\n\nGreene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of reality's true nature may be deeply hidden within them.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d44eb90db8caefef516acc4b68057054567c89b1","amp;dn":"Parallel+Universes+and+the+Deep+Laws+of+the+Cosmos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d44eb90db8caefef516acc4b68057054567c89b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,78,185,13,184,202,239,239,81,106,204,75,104,5,112,84,86,124,137,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
