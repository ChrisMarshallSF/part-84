Chris Clarke had just spent two years building his minimalist timber and steel dream home at Callignee in Gippsland when, less than a week after completion, it was burnt to the ground in the devastating Black Saturday bushfires. With nothing remaining but a concrete slab and a burnt out shell Chris was left shattered and numb.\n\nAfter recovering from the initial grief he was determined to re-build and re-use every last salvageable element of the original house. What he creates in the year or so following is simply remarkable. By adding sturdy recycled elements with the latest fire resistant materials, Chris sets out to produce a tough, resilient version of the original home (now dubbed Callignee One). Wearing its embattled past as a badge of honour, will Callignee Two not only face up to the Aussie bush?\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aece397598ce8c79a68173c8e4b56cdefbe94c3","amp;dn":"Grand+Designs+Australia+-+S01E01+-+Bushfire+House%2C+Callignee%2C+Vi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aece397598ce8c79a68173c8e4b56cdefbe94c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,236,227,151,89,140,232,199,154,104,23,60,142,75,86,205,239,190,148,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
