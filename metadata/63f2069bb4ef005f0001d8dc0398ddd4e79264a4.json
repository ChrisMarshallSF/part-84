This statement, made on camera, was purposefully leaked to an Israeli reporter and printed in the weekend addition of Ma'ariv, Israel's leading daily newspaper, with the military censor's approval. Since that day, Israel's foreign intelligence agency has waged a war of attrition against me with the enthusiastic co-operation of its cabal of North American Zionist organizations.\n\nFor years as a Canadian-born, Israeli-raised former Mossad caseworker I was unwilling to accept the possibility of a wide conspiracy against me. After all, my book had finally been published. What more harm could I do to the country I had left in disgust to return to the land of my birth. Only hitting rock bottom has finally jolted me out of this state of innocence--and optimism that a change of luck is just around the corner. I'm now convinced that I am the target of a broad collusion between elements of the Israeli government and their gofers, mostly in the American Jewish community.\n\n...Radio and television interviews that were scheduled by my publisher were canceled almost as soon as they were booked. A speaker's bureau in Toronto, which seldom had trouble arranging speaking engagements with student and other groups eager to have me as a speaker, found that the engagements were cancelled before I could appear. In fact, the cancellations occurred each time a local B'nai Brith Anti-Defamation League (ADL) chapter got wind of them, and they always did.\n\nBut, of course, the less I spoke, the more time I had to write. In 1995, when my third book, The Other side of the Deception, another work of non-fiction, was published, the efforts against me were stepped up.\n\nSo, on Oct. 21, 1995, I was surprised to be invited by Canadian Television (CTV) producer Ron Fine to do a guest appearance on &quot;Canada AM,&quot; the widely viewed Canadian version of &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; Scheduled to appear on the same program, via satellite from Israel, was Israeli journalist Yosef Lapid, the former head of Israeli television.\n\n...On cue, Lapid repeated, as I listened, his call for my assassination on the Canadian television show, but this time with a twist. He said that, since Israel's Mossad could not kill me in Canada without causing a diplomatic incident, &quot;I hope that there would be a decent Jew in Canada who would do the job for us.&quot;\n\n...A radio host named Tim Kern, from a station in Denver, Colorado, called me up for an interview. Several days later he sent a file on me he had received from the &quot;Mountain state regional office of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith.&quot; The ADL communication suggested that the station drop the interview, claiming that I am an unreliable subject.* The sequence was repeated over and over at radio and television stations in the United States in the United States and Canada. Ironically, supposedly separate Jewish organizations around the United States kept coming up with the same wording in their efforts to shut me up.\n\nThe same people who presumably would praise someone from the CIA or the U.S armed forces who exposed serious wrong-doing in those institutions were now hard of work to smother my criticisms of an intelligence agency for a foreign country that, to put it a charitably as possible does not have America's best interest at heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f2069bb4ef005f0001d8dc0398ddd4e79264a4","amp;dn":"Victor+Ostrovsky+-+The+Other+Side+of+Deception+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f2069bb4ef005f0001d8dc0398ddd4e79264a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,242,6,155,180,239,0,95,0,1,216,220,3,152,221,212,231,146,100,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
