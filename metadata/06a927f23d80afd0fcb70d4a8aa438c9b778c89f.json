I can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t tell you how many people have checked this box without reading\nit because they saw it in a tutorial or someone else told them to do it, and\nthen they can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t figure out why abgx360 says you need to enable online\nfunctions. Please stop writing/following tutorials! Just read the Quickstart\ntopics, the tutorial is right there.\n- Checking for updates to GameNameLookup.csv is now optional (the csv was\neating 50% of our bandwidth and you probably don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need it anyway since the\ngame name can be retrieved directly from the Xex)\n- Fixed a bug where folders would be considered files when parsing the ISO\nfilesystem on some recent games\n- Fixed a bug where default.pe (a temporary file used when decompressing a\ncompressed default.xex) wasn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t being deleted automatically\n- Fixed a bug where unicode code point 160 (no-break space) would be displayed\nin a CLI window as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; instead of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n- Small changes to the way some messages are displayed (harder to miss)\n\nChanges affecting Windows:\n\n- Now storing data files in the AppData folder to prevent errors related to\npermissions and UAC. You can open the GUI and hit Ctrl+F to find out where\nyour StealthFiles are now stored and optionally have it opened for you.\nabgx360 will still check for Video ISOs in the old install directory first\nthough, so you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t need to move that 3rd Wave Video ISO if you have it\nsaved there already.\n- Using libcurl 7.19.6 which should hopefully fix some strange connection\nproblems affecting a small percentage of users\n\nChanges affecting Linux/BSD:\n\n- Fixed a bug on 64 bit systems which made it impossible to read PFI/Video\nexceptions from abgx360.dat\n- Added code to the unix version of kbhit() to prevent hanging when abgx360 is\nlaunched as a background process\n\nChanges affecting Mac OS X:\n\n- Fixed a bug where abgx360 would fail to launch if you supplied a filename\nthat contained an apostrophe\n- Changed the dark gray text used for things like achievement type to normal\ngray since it was actually showing up black (invisible on a black background)\n- Removed GUI option to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Use Terminal font characters\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (this refers to a\nWindows font which replicates CP437 characters and not Terminal.app)\n\n\nSpecial Note: It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s recommended to wait for iXtreme LT (Lite Touch) before you\nplay any more backups or originals on an unbanned console flashed with custom\nfirmware.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06a927f23d80afd0fcb70d4a8aa438c9b778c89f","amp;dn":"Wave+Patches+1-11+%5BONE+2+NV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06a927f23d80afd0fcb70d4a8aa438c9b778c89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,169,39,242,61,128,175,208,252,183,13,74,138,164,56,201,183,120,200,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
