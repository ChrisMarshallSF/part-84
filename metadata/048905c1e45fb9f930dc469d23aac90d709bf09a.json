     Unlocking the autistic mind\n\n        Imagine not being  able to engage  with the world  around you.\n        Imagine not being  able to express  your feelings, dreams  and\n        aspirations  to anyone,  even if  those feelings,  dreams and\n        aspirations are in no way  less or inferior to those  of other\n        people. Imagine having to depend upon the assistance of others\n        with every  mundane task,  like dressing  or feeding yourself.\n        Imagine living with all of these limitations, despite being of\n        sound mind - aware of  everything that is going on  around you\n        but incapable of letting anyone know.\n\n        Narrated by  Academy Award-winning  actress Kate  Winslet, The\n        Sunshine Boy tells the story of Margret, a mother who has done\n        everything in  her power  to help  her 11  year-old son, Keli.\n        Keli is severely autistic - his mother doesnt even know if he\n        understands  Icelandic,  let alone  other  languages. Even  if\n        Margret holds  no unrealistic  expectations on  behalf of  her\n        son,  she  has a  quenchless  thirst for  knowledge  about the\n        mysterious and complex condition that autism undeniably is.\n\n        Margret  travels  to  the  United  States,  where  she   meets\n        scientists in the  field of autism  and autism therapies,  and\n        the parents of autistic children  who share her wish to  break\n        down the wall between the children and the surrounding  world.\n        After an  encounter with  Soma Mukhopadhyay,  an Indian mother\n        who  has  developed  a unique  prompting  method  for training\n        autistic children and teenagers, Margret learns that, perhaps,\n        it is possible  to break down  the wall of  autism and get  to\n        know the individual behind it...\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n         Margrt Dagmar Ericsdttir  ....
