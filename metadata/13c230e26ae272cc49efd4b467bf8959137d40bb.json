This gem of a horror film has been bomb-shelled by critics. But for what reason? I have seen this film start to finish and I must say that director Eddie Romero makes use of the little resources he has to make a thought-provoking horror film that deals with many topics: re-incarnation, redemption and the very essence of evil. The first thing I noticed about the film was the beautiful and photography used by the director which gives and ethnic perspective to the movie and he script and dialogue captivated me throughout. The ending climax is very well done. Do not expect over-the-top special effects, but rather a chilling tale that will leave you thinking about the film long after you see it. \n\nPlot:\n-----\nSatan saves Joseph Langdon/Philip Rogers (John Ashley) from death on condition he become his disciple. As it turns out, he becomes a hairy murderous beast: a werewolf on the rampage carrying out the evil deeds of the devil.\n\n...................................................................................\n\nThis file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player. \nJust burn the files onto a CD using Nero or Ashampoo Buring Studio by making a DATA CD.\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player \n                       (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC.\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
