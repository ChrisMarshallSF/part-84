Originally named X (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¯ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¹), the group achieved their breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second album Blue Blood. They started out as a power/speed metal band and later gravitated towards a progressive sound, at all times retaining an emphasis on ballads. Their sound is extremely raw, sometimes countered by the incorporation of classical style piano passages and vocal melodies. They have well-developed percussion parts and often use harmonized guitar riffs and solos.\n\nBesides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of the visual kei movement. They were known in their early years for their excessively large hairstyles resembling fountains, but toned these down in later years. As of 2010, the band has sold over thirty million records and over two million home videos.\n\nAfter sixteen years, four albums, and selling out the 50,000 seat Tokyo Dome 18 times, X Japan disbanded in 1997.[/quote]\n\n[color=Red]\nScreens[/color]\n[img]http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/hs006.snc6/165655_128956563838269_100001717791478_190889_5793380_n.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/hs006.snc6/165655_128956567171602_100001717791478_190890_385018_n.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/hs026.snc6/165655_128956570504935_100001717791478_190891_607870_n.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[color=Red]Some Links to Check out\n[/color]\n[color=Navy]Official Site - [/color] [url]http://www.xjapanmusic.com/[/url]\n[color=Navy]Fan Site -[/color] [url]http://www.xjapan.de/[/url]\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1082c436239bec01f183618c42eed14a4e64586d","amp;dn":"X+Japan+Last+Live+DvD+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1082c436239bec01f183618c42eed14a4e64586d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,130,196,54,35,155,236,1,241,131,97,140,66,238,209,74,78,100,88,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
