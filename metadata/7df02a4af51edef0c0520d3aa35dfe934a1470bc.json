Man (French: Il ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tait une foisÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ l'homme) is a French animated TV series from 1978 directed by Albert BarillÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. The series explains world history in a format designed for children. The action focuses around one group. The same familiar characters appear in all episodes as they deal with the problems of their time.\nThe show's introduction and ending famously use Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. Shortening the piece to only 2 minutes in length, the introduction uses the very beginning, which jumps into the start of the middle section and finally the dramatic ending to coincide with the destruction of Earth at the end of the intro.\nEpisodes1.And Earth was createdÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, first broadcast on 1979-03-23\n2.Neanderthal Man, first broadcast on 1979-03-30\n3.Cro-Magnon Man, first broadcast on 1979-04-06\n4.The Fertile Valleys, first broadcast on 1979-04-13\n5.The First Empires, first broadcast on 1979-04-20\n6.The Age of Pericles, first broadcast on 1979-04-27\n7.The Pax Romana, first broadcast on 1979-05-11\n8.The Conquest of Islam, first broadcast on 1979-05-18\n9.The Carolingians, first broadcast on 1979-05-25\n10.The Age of Vikings, first broadcast on 1978-04 as pilot, rebroadcast in series on 1979-06-01\n11.The Cathedral Builders, first broadcast on 1979-06-08\n12.The Travels of Marco Polo, first broadcast on 1979-06-15\n13.The Hundred Years' War, first broadcast on 1979-06-22\n14.The Quattrocento, first broadcast on 1981-09-05\n15.The Golden Age of Spain, first broadcast on 1981-09-12\n16.Elizabethan England, first broadcast on 1981-09-19\n17.The Golden Age of the Low Countries, first broadcast on 1981-09-26\n18.The Great Reign of Louis XIV, first broadcast on 1981-10-01\n19.Peter the Great and his Times, first broadcast on 1981-10-08\n20.The Age of Reason (18th), first broadcast on 1981-10-16\n21.America, first broadcast on 1981-10-22\n22.1789ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ1814 (The French Revolution), first broadcast on 1981-10-29\n23.The Awakening of the People (Revolutions of 1848), first broadcast on 1981-11-05\n24.The &quot;Belle ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â°poque&quot; (1900 to 1914), first broadcast on 1981-11-12\n25.The Crazy Years, first broadcast on 1981-11-19\n26.Once Upon a TimeÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the Earth (and tomorrow?), first broadcast on 1981-11-26\n\nIl Etait Une Fois... l'homme Once Upon a TimeÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Man 1978 DVD1-6 Fr+Eng\nOrigin.DVD9 1-6.
