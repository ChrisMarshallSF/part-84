If you do youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll forever remain in\nFactory/Service mode ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the point of no return. Maybe someone, some day will figure out a clever\nway if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re stuck, but till then, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been warned.\nThe idea behind JaicraBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s patched Lv2diag.self is that your Blu-ray drive, should that be broken,\nwill be skipped during the PS3UPDAT.PUP scan, which means you can downgrade/upgrade your\nfirmware without a functional Blu-ray drive present. Personally I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know a broken Blu-ray\ndrive would prevent you from doing that, but hey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ you learn something new everyday.\nThe other reason this patch was created is for PS3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s with a 256MB NAND. If you recall\ndowngrading a PS3 with a 256MB NAND will render Blu-ray playback inoperable. This aims to fix\nthat when downgrading from 3.50/3.55 to 3.41. Again: do not attempt a downgrade from 3.56.\nThis Lv2diag.self is to be used as the first in any PS3 downgrading procedure. Remember two (2)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLv2diag.selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ files are used: 1) for performing the actual downgrade while in Factory/Service\nmode; and 2) for exiting Factory/Service mode, returning your PS3 to normal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c2a6e60099fad55e665224afe090b4d6c8a1a31","amp;dn":"Blu-ray+Patched+Lv2diag+for+Downgrading+PS3+Firmware","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c2a6e60099fad55e665224afe090b4d6c8a1a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,42,110,96,9,159,173,85,230,101,34,74,254,9,11,77,108,138,26,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
