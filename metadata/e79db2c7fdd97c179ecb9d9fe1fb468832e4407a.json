He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals &quot;escape&quot; in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e79db2c7fdd97c179ecb9d9fe1fb468832e4407a","amp;dn":"Shutter+Island+%282010%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e79db2c7fdd97c179ecb9d9fe1fb468832e4407a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,157,178,199,253,217,124,23,158,203,157,159,225,251,70,136,50,228,64,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
