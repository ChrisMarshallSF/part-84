Presenting a mixed cast from Spain, Mexico, and Argentina, it has truly a Latin flavour to it, quite sensual and suggestive. Rising to a higher tension than the English version, it actually runs almost 30 minutes longer than Lugosi's Dracula, which was filmed simultaneously. \nDirector Melford not only adapted but extended the script and action in an original way. The final result is a blend of mystery, sensuality, terror, and comedy. Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield is quite delirious and delivers an unforgettable performance.\nThis torrent includes a 4-minute introduction with actress Lupita Tovar, who offers delicious insight into the creation and spirit of this great movie.\nEn otras palabras, hablamos de un DrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cula con sabor latino...\n***************************\nArchives in this torrent: \n- Interview with Lupita Tovar: VTS_01_1.vob (84 Mb)\n- Dracula (Part I): VTS_02_1.vob (1,05 Gb)\n- Dracula (Part II): VTS_02_2.vob (761 Mb)\nTotal: 1,8 Gb - 108 min.\n***************\nCREDITS:\nDirector: \nGeorge Melford\nWriters:\nBram Stoker (novel)\nBaltasar FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez CuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (Spanish adaptation)\nCast:\nCarlos VillarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­as...
