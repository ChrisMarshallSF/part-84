Come to think of it, he's not that well known within folk circles. That's a real shame. Because he is arguably the best song writer Britain has produced since the war. Yes, seriously. He has a facility with words, an understanding of their possibilities, which can only be described as poetic. And he combines this with a penetrating eye and a sharp tongue, making his songs memorable, effective and thought-provoking. Even after 20 years, I can listen to `News from Nowhere', `The World Turned Upside Down' of `Palaces of Gold' over and over again with a tear of disappointed, old-labour sentiment dewing the corner of my eye, while others like `We Sell Everything' and `Sing a Song to Please Us' remain fresh and funny. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/22/leon-rosselson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/22/leon-rosselson/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:267da405c0da0118d323299ca365ba0705de5ac0","amp;dn":"Leon+Rosselson...Rosselsongs%281999%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"267da405c0da0118d323299ca365ba0705de5ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,125,164,5,192,218,1,24,211,35,41,156,163,101,186,7,5,222,90,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
