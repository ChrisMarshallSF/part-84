I would simply classify them as melodic rock. They're not as heavy as stoner rock, yet they are much more hard-hitting than jam bands or the Jack Johnsons of the world. I'm gonna stop there, because far more talented writers have written reviews on them, so I encourage you to check those out if you like to do some research before downloading.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1206157c33d40a8c8d657570e2ae5240509992f","amp;dn":"Movers+%26+Shakers+-+Larrabee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1206157c33d40a8c8d657570e2ae5240509992f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,32,97,87,195,61,64,168,200,214,87,87,14,42,229,36,5,9,153,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
