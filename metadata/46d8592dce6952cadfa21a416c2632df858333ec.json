Add text, images and signatures, make corrections, fill out PDF forms, and even OCR scanned text.\n\nMake changes and mark up PDFs\n\nWith PDFpenPro, you can add text, images and signature to your PDFs. You can even correct text in the original PDF. Use PDFpenProÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tools to highlight, underline, or strikethrough text. Add comments and notes to share with others.\n\nRemove private information with the redaction feature, new in PDFpenPro 5. Select the text you want to omit, and redact it with a black box or a blank space--either way, the text is removed from the document. Remove a word, phrase or social security number throughout a document with search-and-redact or search-and-remove.\n\nPaperless Workflow\n\nReduce the amount of paper in your office. Scan documents directly into PDFpenPro and then use PDFpenProÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the scanned text, so you can search, edit, and copy it.\n\nSay goodbye to your fax machine! Instead of printing a contract to sign and mail back, you can add your signature to the PDF and email it.\n\nEasy to Use\n\nIn PDFpenProÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Library, you can store frequently-used images, signatures and text so they are always at your fingertips when you want to add them to a PDF.\n\nDrag-and-drop to rearrange pages or to combine pages from different PDFs.
