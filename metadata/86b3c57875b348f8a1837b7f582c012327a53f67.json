Exception is on side 4B, which seems to have degraded so much that the first ten minutes is practicaly useless, and the rest sounds very bad.\n\n\n\nStrangely, the cassettes seem to run in this order: 3, 2, 1, 4. NOT 1, 2, 3, 4. Nope, I don't understand why either.\n\n\n\nIf you're using windows, you can use VLC (http://www.videolan.org/) to play these files. On most GNU/Linux distros, they should play automatically. No idea about mac.\n\n\n\nalecjw, January 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b3c57875b348f8a1837b7f582c012327a53f67","amp;dn":"Czech+in+Three+Months+Cassettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b3c57875b348f8a1837b7f582c012327a53f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,179,197,120,117,179,72,248,161,131,123,127,88,44,1,35,39,165,63,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
