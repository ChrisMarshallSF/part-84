This release contained what would ultimately prove to be their greatest hit, &quot;Jackie Blue,&quot; which ended up peaking at number three on the pop chart. Although &quot;Jackie Blue&quot; is by far the least countrified track on the album, it embodies the casual, understated groove of the band that could be found on any of the Daredevils' releases. Although when examined closely the album is really three neatly separate albums by three maturing songwriters (John Dillon, Steve Cash, and the underrated Larry Lee), the thread of their relaxed atmosphere and light harmonies runs throughout the album, binding it together as a cohesive whole. ~ Zac Johnson\n\nRecorded at Ruedi Valley Ranch, Aldrich, Missouri in 1974.
