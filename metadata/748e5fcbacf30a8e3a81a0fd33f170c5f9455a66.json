A handful of European countries first marked the day in 1911 following a declaration by the Socialist Party of America. The United Nations has recognized March 8th as International Women's Day since 1975. Kavita Ramdas of the Global Fund for Women joins us to discuss the history of International Women's Day, the most pressing issues women face today, and the connection between women's rights and the fight for workers' rights in Wisconsin.\n\n\n- Novelist Ahdaf Soueif on Egypt's Revolution: &quot;People Were Rediscovering Themselves&quot;\n\nEgyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif took part in Egypt's revolution and was in Cairo's Tahrir Square nearly every day of the 18-day popular uprising. She joins us in our studio to discuss the revolution and its significance. &quot;Almost overnight a civic space was created in Tahrir Square that was the ideal space, that one imagined, that everybody imagined, how the country should be or how any country should be,&quot; Soueif says. &quot;Everybody was finding the best in themselves and putting it forward.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:748e5fcbacf30a8e3a81a0fd33f170c5f9455a66","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+08+mar+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"748e5fcbacf30a8e3a81a0fd33f170c5f9455a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,142,95,203,172,243,10,142,58,129,160,253,51,241,112,197,249,69,90,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
