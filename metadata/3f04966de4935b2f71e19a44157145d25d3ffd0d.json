Its only a\n              matter of time before a devastating earthquake hits a\n              major American city and wipes it off the map.\n              Scientists now believe that day could be sooner than\n              we thought. And its not Los Angeles or San Francisco\n              thats in danger. But Seattle, Washington, the crown\n              jewel of a region called Cascadia in Americas Pacific\n              Northwest. Scientists fear Cascadia could suffer a\n              catastrophe of global proportions: a megathrust\n              earthquake. It is the largest earthquake the planet\n              can create.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f04966de4935b2f71e19a44157145d25d3ffd0d","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Countdown.to.Catastrophe.Mega.Quake.Japan.an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f04966de4935b2f71e19a44157145d25d3ffd0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,4,150,109,228,147,91,47,113,225,154,68,21,113,69,210,93,63,253,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
