New components are posted every Thursday and coders can choose a component from a list of Java and .NET components, and they have a week to design or develop their chosen component. Each week new components are posted. Development components are generally components that have been designed in a previous component design contest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0716c55008c7fa473065151f197b2c200b7bc3c","amp;dn":"Leaked+TopCoder+submissions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0716c55008c7fa473065151f197b2c200b7bc3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,113,108,85,0,140,127,164,115,6,81,81,241,151,178,194,0,183,188,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
