All Of These Things\n2. Fireman Joe\n3. The Weepin' Willow\n4. How Would You Plead?\n5. M.D.D.P. Limited\n6. Pushin' Fear II\n7. Rough Neck Blues\n8. Someone Told Me\n9. Poor Howard \n\nOriginally a master of high powered electric guitar (as a member of the late '70's proto-punk band, The Saints) Ed Keupper routinely demonstrates his mastery of both electric and accoustic guitar. He writes beautiful and quirky songs. As with many true originals he also has an unusual singing voice, a voice which suits his songs (and this work) perfectly.\n\nEd is reportedly particularly happy with this album and for very good reason. So many different stylistic approaches co-exist on this album and yet manage to fit together in a cohesive whole.\n\nOne reviewer in Australia (Ed's place of birth) suggested that a public holiday should be declared on the strength of the song &quot;All of these things&quot;.\n\nOthers albums highly recommended are &quot;Character Assassination&quot; and &quot;Honey Steels Gold&quot;. Check him out - you'll be so glad you did. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af97f8caadec1993fdd405cdd1bbfc0d36fdd91","amp;dn":"Ed+Kuepper+Frontier+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af97f8caadec1993fdd405cdd1bbfc0d36fdd91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,249,127,140,170,222,193,153,63,221,64,92,221,27,191,192,211,111,221,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
