C++ For Dummies starts\nfrom the beginning (where else?) and works its way from early concepts and\nthrough more sophisticated techniques. It doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t assume that you have any\nprior knowledge, at least, not of programming.\nC++ For Dummies is rife with examples. Every concept is documented in numerous\nsnippets and several complete programs.\nUnlike other C++ programming books, C++ For Dummies considers the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\njust as important as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhow.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The features of C++ are like pieces of a jigsaw\npuzzle. Rather than just present the features, I think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important that you\nunderstand how they fit together.\nIf you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t understand why a particular feature is in the language, you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\ntruly understand how it works. After you finish this book, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be able to write\na reasonable C++ program, and, just as important, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll understand why and\nhow it works.\nC++ For Dummies can also be used as a reference: If you want to understand\nwhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going on with all the template stuff, just flip to Chapter 27, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re\nthere. Each chapter contains necessary references to other earlier chapters\nin case you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t read the chapters in sequence.\nC++ For Dummies is not operating- or system-specific. It is just as useful to Unix\nor Linux programmers as it is to Windows-based developers. C++ For Dummies\ndoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t cover Windows or .NET programming. You have to master C++ before\nyou can move on to Windows and .NET programming.&quot;\n\nCD Portions NOT included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea8c870915f2191c28097d68a1cfd79ccea69180","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B+For+Dummies+%5B5th+Edition%5D+NO+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea8c870915f2191c28097d68a1cfd79ccea69180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,140,135,9,21,242,25,28,40,9,125,104,161,207,215,156,206,166,145,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
