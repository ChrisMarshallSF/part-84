The English version was performed by Limahl and Beth Anderson; the French version was performed by Limahl and Ann Calvert.[1] It was a success in many countries, reaching No. 1 Norway and Sweden, No. 2 in Austria, Germany and Italy, No. 4 in the UK and No. 6 in the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nBackground and writing\n----------------------\nThe song was composed by Giorgio Moroder with lyrics by Keith Forsey, although it (and other electronic pop elements of the soundtrack) is not present in the German version of the film, which features Klaus Doldinger's score exclusively.\n\nBeth Anderson recorded her lyrics in America separately from Limahl's.[1] Anderson does not appear in the music video; frequent Limahl backup singer Mandy Newton lip syncs Anderson's lyrics.\n\nAs a reference to the film and its title, the song has no distinctive beginning, nor an end. While many songs fade out, NeverEnding Story not only fades out, but also fades in, thus making it &quot;never ending&quot;.\n\n\nAbout Limahl\n------------\nLimahl (born Christopher Hamill, 19 December 1958) is an English pop singer. He rose to fame as the lead singer of the 1980s pop group Kajagoogoo, before embarking on a briefly successful solo career, which reached its peak with the 1984 hit &quot;NeverEnding Story&quot;, taken from the film of the same name.\n\n\nLyrics\n------\nTurn around - look at what you see.\nIn her face the mirror of your dreams.\nMake believe on everywhere\nget it in the line.\nHidden on the pages is the answer\nTo a never ending story.\n\nReach the stars\nfly a fantasy\nDream a dream and what you see will be.\n\nRhymes that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds\nAnd there upon the rainbow is the answer\nTo a never ending story\nstory.\nShow your fear\nfor she may fade away\nIn your hands the birth of a new day.\n\nRhymes that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds . ..\nNever ending story\nnever ending story\nnever ending story . . . \n\n...................................................................................\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
