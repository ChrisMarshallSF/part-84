Anthem\n\nLength: 53:58\n\nNotes:\nJEMS master recording. This transfer was originally done and posted in 2008 by Butterking. The same raw transfer files were used here but everything else was redone from scratch(speed correction, downsampling and tracking) for this repost (Sept 2009). Rush were the support act for Rory Gallagher this night. This show captures Rush on their very first tour touring in support of their self titled debut.\n\nButterking's original notes:\n\nBased on notes I found at DigitalRushExperience.com, this is considered a significant recording in Rush collecting circles as the best audie from the band's first-album tour.\n\nThe entry for the show at Digital Rush gives the history of this tape as being found in the back of a closet as a first gen, transferred to VHS hi-fi with some static and drop out problems, then to CD-R from which it has circulated widely.\n\nThis then is the first transfer from the master cassette (Scotch normal bias). There's a chunk of Rory Gallagher's encore on the flip side so I assume Rush was opening for him. I haven't had a chance to call &quot;S&quot; to ask him what he recalls about this recording, but we can probably assume it was recorded like nearly every tape we made at the Paramount, from the last row of the main floor next to the curtain sash where we would mount the microphone. Samples provided.\n\nI'd describe myself as a light, slightly closeted Rush fan, but seeing this on shelf at JEMS' northwest &quot;vault,&quot; I thought it merited a fresh airing here. I've done nothing but transfer, stitch together the two sides, and add a fade in and out.\n\nAfter all, somebody else needs to post a Rush show other than GeddyonDime, right? I hope he especially appreciates this.\n\nButterking for JEMS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:361de52ee2382211b56666a6210c3231bcdf4396","amp;dn":"Rush+1974-11-19+-+Seattle%2C+WA+%28JEMS+Master%29+FLAC+LOSSLESS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"361de52ee2382211b56666a6210c3231bcdf4396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,29,229,46,226,56,34,17,181,102,102,166,33,12,50,49,188,223,67,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
