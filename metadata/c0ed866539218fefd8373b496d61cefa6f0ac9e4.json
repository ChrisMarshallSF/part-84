Clayton grew up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and began to play harmonica and guitar at the age of 7. At 9 he received his first steel guitar.\n\nAfter quitting the Air Force he moved to Nashville in 1968 and began his career as a songwriter. His first success was the song &quot;Ladies Love Outlaws&quot; which became a Number 11 hit in the Billboard Charts by Waylon Jennings in 1972. The country music style outlaw country was derived from that song. In 1973 he released his first album simply titled Lee Clayton, with which, as Clayton would later say, he was very dissatisfied. In the following years he continued his songwriting. He wrote songs like &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; for Jerry Jeff Walker or &quot;If You Could Touch Her at All&quot; for Willie Nelson. In 1978 his second album, Border Affair, was released. It was critically acclaimed but became a flop at the charts.\n\nHis most successful album was 1979's Naked Child. The albums' style was reminiscent of Bob Dylan and the single, &quot;I Ride Alone&quot;, became very notable. In 1979, he went on a big world tour which became a huge success. In 1981 he released his last studio album, The Dream Goes On, which had a harder sound than his previous work. After that he published two autobiographical books and, in 1990, released a live album entitled Another Night which was recorded in Oslo. Also in 1990, The Highwaymen, an outlaw country supergroup comprising Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, had a minor hit with a song of his, &quot;Silver Stallion&quot;, which had previously appeared on Border Affair. In 1994 he released the album Spirit of the twilight. Cat Power also covered &quot;Silver Stallion&quot; on the popular 2008 cover album &quot;Jukebox&quot;. Today Clayton's career has largely gone silent.\n\n&quot;Border Affair The Capitol Years&quot; contains the three Capitol albums &quot;Border Affair&quot;, &quot;Naked Child&quot; and &quot;The Dream Goes On&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01 Silver Stallion  \n02 If You Can Touch Her At All\n03 Back Home In Tennessee \n04 Border Affair\n05 Old Number Nine \n06 Like A Diamond \n07 My Women My Love \n08 Tequila Is Addictive \n09 My True Love \n10 Rainbow In The Sky \n11 Saturday Night Special \n12 I Ride Alone \n13 10,000 Light Years / Sexual Moon  \n14 Wind And Rain\n\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01 I Love You  \n02 Jaded Virgin  \n03 A Little Cocaine  \n04 If I Can Do It (So Can You) \n05 What's A Mother Gonna Do\n06 Industry \n07 Won't You Give Me One More Chance  \n08 Draggin' Them Chains \n09 Where Is The Justice \n10 Whatcha Gonna Do\n11 Oh How Lucky I Am  \n12 The Dream Goes On \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ed866539218fefd8373b496d61cefa6f0ac9e4","amp;dn":"Lee+Clayton+-+Border+Affair+The+Capitol+Years++%5B2007%5D++%5BRobbie60","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0ed866539218fefd8373b496d61cefa6f0ac9e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,237,134,101,57,33,143,239,216,55,59,73,109,97,206,250,111,10,201,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
