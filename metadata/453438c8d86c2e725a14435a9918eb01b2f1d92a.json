ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot to love about this Danish diva and her 27-song compilation.\n\nTina is blessed with a graceful voice and a warm, thoughtful heart. Her songs glimmer with the sheen of a coat of sugar. Her voice will blow you away while her lyrics make you think and feel with her sensual R&amp;B voice including an almost yodeling quality in her vibrato. Tina is the queen of hitting emotional high notes and coming back down and dirty. She blends country harmonies with alternative rock vocals and folky lyrics that are deep and thoughtful, with emotion pouring out through the hole in her heart.\n\nMost of the tracks feature a guitar or piano with stringed accompaniment. She hits dischordal high notes and has a few tracks with male vocal harmonies in addition to some songs with sultry and playful using a vocal fry technique for low, sexy vocal tones. Half of Welcome Back Colour (Welcome Up) features her radio hits and new tracks. It is more upbeat with drums and electric guitar. These adult contemporary pop hits are well produced, catchy, and will have you singing along.\n\nTitle track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWelcome Back ColourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a tune with a catchy groove that has been a hit on Danish radio. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPaper ThinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a cool, minor key song that has good harmonies and a catchy chorus about flying. The stand out track is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWarm Sand,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with its dissonant piano riff that creates a spooky atmosphere with dramatic choral changes and excellent harmonies. Catchy and soothing, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ also has a nice low harmony vocal line under the main vocal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone is all you need to move youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ one word.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The other half of the album (Welcome Down) features stripped-down acoustic songs and leaves the listener wanting more.\n\nTina looks out a window with someone on her mind as she sings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoom With A View.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The high falsetto note she hits will take you away. The thought-provoking lyrics of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe City/LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t change the city, the city changes you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Tina gets her male bashing out with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStrong Man,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which takes a serious tone. It speaks of abuse and a lonely man that needs a female bridge.\n\nTina DicoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s song writing skills shine on Welcome Back Colour as she paints a picture with her words and music that is sure to move US audiences as much as she has in Denmark and England.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/10/tina-dickow/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/10/tina-dickow/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:453438c8d86c2e725a14435a9918eb01b2f1d92a","amp;dn":"Tina+Dico...Welcome+Back+Colour%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"453438c8d86c2e725a14435a9918eb01b2f1d92a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,52,56,200,216,108,46,114,90,20,67,90,153,24,235,1,178,241,217,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
