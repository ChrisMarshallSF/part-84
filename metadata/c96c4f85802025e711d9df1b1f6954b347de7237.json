One hour with news as you do not see it elsewhere.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHeadlines for Apr 01, 2011\n\n- Reports: Dozens of Civilian Casualties in Gaddafi, Western Attacks\n- U.S.: Despite Losses, Gaddafi Forces Remain Intact\n- Report: CIA Operatives Were in Libya Before Presidential Order\n- Ohio Enacts Anti-Union Law, Opponents Seek Referendum\n- Wisconsin GOP Won't Enforce Anti-Union Law Following Injunction\n- NH, OK Lawmakers Advance Anti-Union Bills\n- Maine GOP Seeks Undoing of Child Labor Protections\n- GOP: No Deal Reached in Budget Showdown\n- USAID: GOP Cuts Would Kill 70,000 Children Worldwide\n- Residents Near Damaged Japanese Power Plant Told to Prepare for Lengthy Displacement\n- Gbagbo, Ouattara Forces Clash in Abidjan\n- Saleh Withdraws Offer to Step Down Amidst Ongoing Protests\n- 6 U.S. Troops Killed in Afghanistan\n- Whistleblower Sues California Nuclear Plant Over Firing\n\n\nSpecial reports\n\n- Rep. Kucinich: Lack of Congressional Approval Could Make Obama's Libya Attack &quot;Impeachable Offense&quot;\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio joins us to discuss why he thinks President Obama may have committed an &quot;impeachable offense&quot; by committing U.S. military forces to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya without congressional approval. &quot;This president has assumed power that no president, not even President Bush, has assumed,&quot; Kucinich says. &quot;I think we need to focus on this not as a matter of whether we like President Obama or not, not as a matter of whether we're Democrats or not, but whether or not we understand the basic constitutional principles of the separation of power.&quot;\n\n\n- Democrats Vow to Seek Public Referendum as Ohio Enacts Anti-Union Bill\n\nOhio Republican Gov. John Kasich has signed a bill that strips collective bargaining rights for more than 360,000 state workers and bars them from striking. Democrats have announced plans to collect some 230,000 signatures in the next 90 days to block immediate implementation of the law and put it to a public referendum on the November ballot. &quot;This idea of government of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations has taken hold,&quot; says our guest, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who represents Ohio's 10th district. &quot;Unions are one of the last lines of defense against a corporate plutocracy.&quot;\n\n\n- Ivory Coast Crisis Intensifies as Anti-Gbagbo Forces Surround Presidential Palace\n\nIvory Coast leader Laurent Gbagbo is battling to remain in power as rival Alassane Ouattara's forces surround the main city of Abidjan. Much of the fighting is concentrated around Gbagbo's heavily fortified presidential palace. Ouattara's forces are estimated to control as much as 80 percent of the Ivory Coast. We speak to Corinne Dufka, senior researcher in the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, and Ivory Coast political analyst Gnaka Lagoke of AfricanDiplomacy.com.\n\n\n- Shunning Grassroots That Propelled '08 Election, Obama Turns to Corporate Insider, Anti-Public Option Campaign Manager Jim Messina\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are already gearing up for the 2012 election, projected to be the most expensive in history. Obama is expected to formally kick off his re-election bid on April 14, and his campaign could raise as much as $1 billion. In a move criticized by progressives, Obama has appointed former White House deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina, as his campaign manager. Obama's move has drawn scrutiny over Messiana's ties to corporate America, his push to drop the public option from healthcare reform, and his lack of support for gay rights. We speak with journalist and author Ari Berman about his new profile of Messina in The Nation. &quot;Messina has a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“take no prisoners style,' but what he is doing is often taking Democrats and grassroots prisoner,&quot; Berman says.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c96c4f85802025e711d9df1b1f6954b347de7237","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+01+apr+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c96c4f85802025e711d9df1b1f6954b347de7237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,108,79,133,128,32,37,231,17,217,223,27,31,105,84,179,71,222,114,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
