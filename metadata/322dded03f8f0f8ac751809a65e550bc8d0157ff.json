You can download all but shaving for free from their site, but if you want the actual discs, I don\\'t think they are that expensive, I got both (GROTD and Shaving) for $5 last night.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and PLEASE SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:322dded03f8f0f8ac751809a65e550bc8d0157ff","amp;dn":"Chewing+on+Tinfoil+Discography+%5BPost-Ska+From+Ireland%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"322dded03f8f0f8ac751809a65e550bc8d0157ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,45,222,208,63,143,15,138,199,81,128,154,101,229,80,188,141,1,87,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
