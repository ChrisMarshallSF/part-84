Many programs got confused while trying to open this file, some reported it as stereo, some as 5.1 dolby digital.\n\nI tried many things, including extracting all 6 audio channels and resampling the audio then muxing it back into an AC3 file and trick the header.\n\nThen I figured it out.\n\nWhat's happening is when FOV is recording and editing these episodes he's unintentionally leaving around 200 milliseconds (blank screen) from the previous show that was on BBC.\nAnd guess what, that previous program was stereo in lieu of 5.1 DD.\n\nSo what you have is an audio file that starts out stereo and switches to 5.1 DD, thus causing things to wrong.\n\nI've successfully fixed episode 4 &amp; 5.\nI've still got to do episode 2 (this was also a FOV release)\n\nOnce done, I will put all three in a torrent and put up a link for those PS3ms users that are interested.\n\nAdditionally, I'll be poised to correct the issue should it also occur for episode 6.\n\nCheers,\nAnt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:021169b27e622a655ca3199081188641f8f1b2aa","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+S16+E4%26E5+%5BFixed+Audio+Problems+with+MKV2VOB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"021169b27e622a655ca3199081188641f8f1b2aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,17,105,178,126,98,42,101,92,163,25,144,129,24,134,65,248,241,178,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
