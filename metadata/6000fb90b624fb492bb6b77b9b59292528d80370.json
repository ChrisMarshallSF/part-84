(Energy Never Dies), which boasted the number one single in America -- either ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoom Boom PowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Gotta FeelingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- during fully half of 2009, including every single summer day (and then some). Although the lead single here prominently samples an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“80s touchstone, and on the cover the Peas are displayed as pixelated preteens, Nintendo fashion, The Beginning isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a nostalgia trip. Barring a Slick Rick or Chic sample here and a Mr. Roboto reference there (plus buckets of hi-res synth driving the productions), nothing else directly evokes the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“80s. As on their last two LPs, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heavily reliant on nightclub sloganeering and will.i.amÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s purposefully (?) lame throwback rapping, alongside Auto-Tune harmonies and waves of synth. David Guetta appears on only one track, but his production job for 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Gotta FeelingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ casts a long shadow on this record of donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t-stop-the-party jams and half-baked club-life anthems. It leads off with a pumping first single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Time (Dirty Bit),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ oddly built off ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ(IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Had) The Time of My Life,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the inescapable, treacly duet by Bill Medley &amp; Jennifer Warnes from 1987ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dirty Dancing. It was announced in July 2010 and released four months later, but The Beginning still sounds like it was rush-recorded and rush-released, the results of a string of late-nighters by will.i.am and co-producer DJ Ammo. (Perhaps their latest date with destiny, aka the halftime show of Super Bowl XLV, had something to do with it.) There are plentiful will.i.am vocals and comparatively few features for Fergie and the others, and the songs donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t burrow into your head, earworm-style, like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy HumpsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoom Boom Pow.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Still, there are scattered moments of respectability, including that lone David Guetta production, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Best One Yet (The Boy),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Stop the Party.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6000fb90b624fb492bb6b77b9b59292528d80370","amp;dn":"Black+Eyed+Peas+The+Beginning+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6000fb90b624fb492bb6b77b9b59292528d80370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,0,251,144,182,36,251,73,43,182,183,123,155,89,41,37,40,216,3,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
