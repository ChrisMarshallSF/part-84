Highlights include the Temptations' &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; (later covered by the Rolling Stones), Diana Ross' &quot;I'm Still Waiting,&quot; and Stevie Wonder's ultrafunky take on the Beatles' &quot;We Can Work It Out.&quot; In the spirit of their work with the Temptations, the Supremes join forces with the Four Tops for a cover of Ike &amp; Tina Turner's &quot;River Deep, Mountain High.&quot; As with many Motown covers, this does not pay off as well as the original. Even though Stevie'smoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; is enjoyable, it lacks the mournful seriousness of the Beatles' original. Like many in this series, the set is dominated by the familiar names at Motown: the Temptations, Ross, Smokey Robinson, and so forth. Only a few obscure names make it onto Volume 6: the Elgins, the Velvettes, and R. Dean Taylor. The familiarity of artists will make this album more popular with casual music buyers, if not musical archaeologists hoping to hear unearthed treasures from the tape vault.\n\n\n1.
