To further explain:\nWith the release of the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material), there are now 2 different Between The Buttons releases available, the original UK version that was released on January 20, 1967 and the US version that was released on February 10, 1967. There are now 2 US versions, the original CD release (which is the same mix as the original vinyl release) and the remastered version, which has much better sound, although some reviewers are commenting that not all tracks have been mixed to the same quality level.\n\nIn addition, the UK and US versions include different tracks. The Stones designed the UK release, which did not include the just released single Let's Spend The Night Together and Ruby Tuesday. The American record execs removed Back Street Girl and Please Go Home to make room for the two single cuts. To clarify:\n\nThere are 3 Between The Buttons releases:\nJanuary 20, 1967 - U.K. Decca (remastered on SACD)\n.....does not include Let's Spend The Night Together and Ruby Tuesday\nFebruary 10, 1967 - U.S. London (remastered on SACD)\n.....does not include Back Street Girl and Please Go Home \nFebruary 10, 1967 - U.S. London (not remastered)\n.....does not include Back Street Girl and Please Go Home\n\nBack Street Girl and Please Go Home were released in the U.S. on the Flowers album on July 14, 1967. Let's Spend The Night Together and Ruby Tuesday were released on an album in the U.K. on Through The Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2) on September 12, 1969.\n\nNote: ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog when Allen Klein became their manager in the 70s. The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever). But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material. With the remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio. I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just the Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the World.\n\nThe Between The Buttons tracks were recorded in 1966 as follows:\n\nAug 3-11, 1966 at RCA Studios in Hollywood\n.....Who's Been Sleeping Here?\n.....Miss Amanda Jones\n.....Connection\n.....Back Street Girl\n.....All Sold Out\n.....Please Go Home\n.....Let's Spend The Night Together\n.....Something Happened To Me Yesterday\n.....Cool, Calm, Collected\n.....Complicated\n.....Yesterday's Papers\n.....She Smiled Sweetly\n.....My Obsession\nNov 9-26, 1966 at Olympic and Pye Studios in London\n.....Ruby Tuesday\n.....final mixes were done on all the Aug RCA Studio tracks as well\n\nTracks recorded at the Aug RCA sessions but not released on Between The Buttons were:\n.....Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing In The Shadow?\n.....Who's Driving Your Plane (also released as Who's Driving My Plane)\nTracks recorded at the Aug RCA sessions but never released were:\n.....Panama Powder Room\n.....Godzi\n.....Get Yourself Together\n.....Something BB\nTracks recorded at the Nov Olympic/Pye sessions but not released on Between The Buttons were:\n.....Dandelion\nTracks recorded at the Aug RCA sessions but never released were:\n.....Trouble In Mind\n.....English Summer\n\nAn interesting note is that English Summer was intended as a UK single release, but it was put on hold (and never released) when Brian, Mick, and Keith's arrests began in the summer of 67. We Love You was released instead. It was recorded with Nicky Hopkins, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney as a thank you for fan support during the trials.\n\nThis information comes from &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones&quot; by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.\n\nby Richard R.
