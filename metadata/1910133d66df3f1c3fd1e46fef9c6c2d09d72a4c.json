Without Jesus we are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdead in our transgressionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œobjects of (His) wrathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \nSteve (Dan Arthur) has always felt there was more to life than his dead end and boring life. But he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know how to go about changing it. \nHe also feels trapped by an addiction that is only too common in our world today. The sudden loss of his job forces him to revaluate his priorities. \nHis new life is difficult and unfamiliar.\n\nThis experience drives Steve into a place of prayer and renewed dedication.\n This film is the perfect illustration of the principle found in the popular book, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Purpose Driven LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Rick Warren. \nJeffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film has a lot of polish, and I hope it will inspire its viewers to make their lives count for Christ. I review hundreds of films each year.\n We have all seen some Christian films that are extremely amateurish. Not this one! I highly recommend this film\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Objects-Arthur-Hackett-McCormick-Lysander/dp/B00061LK9S&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Objects-Arthur-Hackett-McCormick-Lysander/dp/B00061LK9S&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLz SEED as long as possible.....\n\nUploaded By Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1910133d66df3f1c3fd1e46fef9c6c2d09d72a4c","amp;dn":"Objects+Of+Wrath%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1910133d66df3f1c3fd1e46fef9c6c2d09d72a4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,16,19,61,102,223,63,28,63,209,228,111,239,156,108,45,9,215,42,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
