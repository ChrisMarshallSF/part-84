Bronson entered the first level of Hell with a chip on his shoulder. He demanded to speak to the Devil himself about his stay. Upon entering the DevilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chamber, he pulled out a .44 Magnum and blew his teeth out the back of his skull. He now rules Hell under his new name, Lucifer Bronson. His first assignment as King of Hell was to write the most evil music ever to be heard by human ears. He wrote countless hours of music and hid it in a secret dimension.\n\nIn Saint Louis, Missouri, four guys were smoking a combination of marijuana and salvia. They uncovered BronsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sheet music and decided to document it for mankind.\n\nThis music can only be recorded under the influence of black weed during Bronsonic rituals. The only people on Earth that can understand the workings of BronsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sheet music are the Ambassadors of Hell, Fister.\n\nCurrent lineup\nMarcus Newstead - Guitar/Vocals\nKenny Snarzyk - Bass/Vocals\nKirk Gatterer - Drums\n\nGenre = Doom / Sludge\nFormat = mp3\nBitrate = 320 kbps\t\nFile Size = 92.68 MB\nTracker = RockBox\t\n\nTracklisting\n1.
