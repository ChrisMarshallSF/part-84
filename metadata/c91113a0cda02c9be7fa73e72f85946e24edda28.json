A terrifying solar eclipse engulfed the skies above Asia. From this gaping darkness, a vicious torrent of meteors rained down on the continent.  Many thought it was the end. After those terrifying moments, many cities were leveled  leaving a wake of smoldering rubble and scorched earth.\n\nChaos and paranoia swept over Asia, forcing the rest of the world to quarantine the continent, an island onto itself.\n\nTwo years later, from this apocalyptic wreckage, rose the new cities with new technologies never seen before.  A  clandestine organization known only as the Sacred Financial Group ascended to power,  shrouded in myth and mystery, brimming with untold wealth and influence.\nThe Group would found four schools, each one unique in its own way: Sacred Gate, Mystic Peak, Phoenix, and Leonair Campus.\n\nOnly the smartest, strongest, fittest students were recruited for these institutions. Yet beneath its quiet faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade of learning and academia, an unsettling truth began to surface. These were no ordinary schools. Their infrastructures, rising menacingly above all others, were strange and alien in design.\n\nSuspicion grew. Were these  institutions meant to breed a new generation of genetically-enhanced athletes? Were they military centers meant to recruit and train bio-engineered soldiers?\n\nSoon, rumors began to spread about the alarming activities conducted within the four campuses. Students, they said, were being trained in cryptic, deadly forms of combat beyond the understanding of even the militaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most accomplished intelligence agencies; they were studying forbidden scrolls and texts believed to hold incomprehensible, supernatural powerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½power to create as well as destroy.  The students were also  being taught the use of  forbidden weapons by Masters exiled long ago for their genocidal role in the Ancient Wars.\n\nThe question was: Why? Why train these students in such brutal martial arts?\n\nThe answer would arrive with startling implications. A dimensional rift some attribute to the meteor storm had opened the gates to a demonic realm, poisoning the living and possessing the dead.\n\nOnly the four schools proved immune to this paranormal plague. Force shields were believed to protect the boundaries of the four schools and its students, keeping them safe within the schoolsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ borders.\n\nThe shields, however, were beginning to show signs of weakness. There were reports of creatures infiltrating school grounds and of students being taken almost daily, never to be seen again.\n\nIt was only a matter of timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nLeonair in the East was the first of the four schools  to fall, its entire student populace devoured seemingly overnight, the campus left as a graveyard of memory.\n\nOf those who have attempted to brave the haunted campus grounds of Leonair since, few have returned, and those that have, speak tremulously of a presence so dark, so evil, it would in time, come to destroy all mankind.\n\nSo many questions remain unanswered. What caused the meteor shower? From what dimension did this supernatural evil originate from? How did the Sacred Financial Group know of the stormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s destructive, malevolent power?\n\nToday, everything is calm and peaceful at the three schools, even as they wonder which of them is next.\n\nWhen will their time come? How long will their shields hold?\n\nFor now, the students continue their studies.\n\nWaiting.\n\nTraining.\n\nPraying.\n\n............................\nTorrent uploaded by:mbdsquad\n............................\n\nThis is only a gamer-made compilation by me who is living somewhere in the Philippines.\n\nIncluded Files:\n---------------\nRan Online Installation Instruction\ndotNetFx_Full_x86_64\nRan Online Client Version 845\nRan Online Patch Version 846\nRan Online Patch Version 847\nRan Online Patch Version 848\nRan Online Patch Version 850 [Password: closeevent]\nRan Online Patch Version 883 [Password: vavabroom]\nRan Online Patch Version 884\nRan Online Patch Version 887\nRan Online Patch Version 923 [Password: beannachteros]\nRan Online Patch Version 924 [Password: aeripheus]\n\nOrder of Installation:\n----------------------\n1.
