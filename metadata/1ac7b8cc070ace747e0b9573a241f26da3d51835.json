So just imagine my surprise and delight when I opened my inbox to find an email from a killer little band...from Alabama. Friends, I'd like you to meet The Dirty Lungs. I think I might just have a little crush on them.\n\nYou see, The Dirty Lungs can make quite an unholy racket, a gritty blend of good old grimey garage, nouveau psych, and even some Stone Roses-esque, splendidly overindulgent instrumentation. It's sleazy, it's nasty, and mercy me it's fantastic. This is a band that abides by the &quot;go big or go home&quot; mentality, cranking out the walls of blistering, beautiful noise and swirling, hazy masses of sound like there's no tomorrow. And maybe there's not. So while there's still a today, might I suggest you spend some time making yourself acquainted with these fellows? You'll be ever so glad you did. http://lesenfantsterriblesmusic.blogspot.com/\n\nThe Dirty Lungs (from Birmingham, AL) are almost worthy of their own post. I knew absolutely nothing about them going into last nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s show, but their set might have been my favorite of the night. They do a retro psych-rock thing with a classic rock sheen, kind of like the last Comets on Fire record. It paired nicely with what Abby Go Go and The N.E.C. do. It looks like theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be back in Atlanta for a couple of shows in July. Check them out. http://littleadvances.com/\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://spaceghetto.org/images/500x500rob.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thedirtylungs.bandcamp.com&quot;/&gt; \n\n1. Love is a Chore\n2.

Many find &quot;Lost in Space / Talk House&quot; to be the highlight.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ac7b8cc070ace747e0b9573a241f26da3d51835","amp;dn":"2011+The+Dirty+Lungs+-+The+Robins+%5BReissue%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ac7b8cc070ace747e0b9573a241f26da3d51835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,199,184,204,7,10,206,116,126,11,149,115,162,65,242,109,163,213,24,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
