Burn it to a disc, and then boot from it with your computer. It's a great tool for recovering a bad install of windows or mac or even another version of linux. This is available for download on the internet, but it may be faster to download it here. Have fun. \n\nBy the way, the beauty of this is that it runs completely from the disc. There are options to install, but you dont have to. Don't master the disc and it will save data (settings, etc) from your session so you have it next time. This is an invaluable tool for anyone who likes computers.
