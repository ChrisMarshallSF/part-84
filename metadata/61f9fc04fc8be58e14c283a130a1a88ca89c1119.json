Just extract as stated.\n\nIncludes 778 SNES Roms and the emulator. I've collected all the USA/EU games I could find, if you have any I don't have let me know with a PM or something. Some unlicensed games may be included, but I'm considering collecting them and uploading them in a separate torrent.\n\nNOTE: I have NOT tested all of the ROMS, but most of them have been tested and work perfectly. If one doesn't work please comment and I'll see if I can find one that does or find out if it's just incompatible with the emulator. I'm running the emulator on version 6.37 OFW, so anything below that I can't vouch for. But it should work!
