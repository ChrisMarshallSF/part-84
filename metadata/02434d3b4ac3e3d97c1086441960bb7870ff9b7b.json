In the book, she reveals how those in power use times of crisis to push through undemocratic and extreme free market economic policies. &quot;The Wisconsin protests are an incredible example of how to resist the shock doctrine,&quot; Klein says.\n\n\n- Naomi Klein: Tim DeChristopher Guilty Verdict Exposes &quot;Double Standard&quot; of How &quot;Oil and Gas Companies Privatize Profits...Externalize the Cost&quot;\n\nEnvironmental activist Tim DeChristopher was convicted last week of two felony counts for disrupting an auction of more than 100,000 acres of federal land for oil and gas drilling in December 2008. &quot;What did Tim DeChristopher do wrong? They said he participated in an auction and without the intention to pay,&quot; Klein says. &quot;Oil and gas companies privatize the profits from their resource extraction but externalize the cost, being the pollution and the cleanup...Climate change is the biggest disaster of all. The highest price tag of all created by the fossil fuel industry...They have no intention of paying that cost.&quot;\n\n\n- &quot;My Fear is that Climate Change is the Biggest Crisis of All&quot;: Naomi Klein Warns Global Warming Could Be Exploited by Capitalism and Militarism\n\nAward-winning journalist Naomi Klein has been reporting on global warming and the climate justice movement for years. &quot;My fear is that climate change is the biggest crisis of all,&quot; Klein says. &quot;If we do not come up with a positive vision of how climate change can make our economies and our world more just, more livable, cleaner, fairer, then this crisis will be exploited to militarize our economies, to create fortress continents. We are really facing a choice. What we really need now is for the people fighting for economic justice and environmental justice to come together.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02434d3b4ac3e3d97c1086441960bb7870ff9b7b","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+09+mar+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02434d3b4ac3e3d97c1086441960bb7870ff9b7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,67,77,59,74,195,227,217,124,16,134,68,25,96,187,120,112,255,155,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
