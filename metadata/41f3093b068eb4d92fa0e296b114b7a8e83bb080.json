Not so. Singer Omar Dykes has been a proponent of jump since carving out a niche for himself in Austin back in the mid-'70s. Through heady times (like having a 1986 recording contract with Columbia/CBS Records in pocket) and lean ones, Dykes has kept going as a generally dependable source of Texas blues, blues rock, Delta-flavored R&amp;B, and what have you. Always sounding like a cross between Wolfman Jack and a blood relation of Howlin' Wolf, he acts out the lyrics to the dozen cover songs here with typical fervor as his band and various guests alertly supply the swing or shuffle rhythms and solos.\nOmar has a great voice, very distinct, and very cool. It cuts through on tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMr. Blues Is Coming To Town,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the very funny (and very true) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œQuite Whiskey.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ And I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d ever hear a cover of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHit The Road, JackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that could sound good, simply because Ray Charles version is so definitive. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s featured here and it cooks.\nOmar doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play as much guitar here as he has on past efforts, but when he does, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tasteful and to the point. And on other cuts, Derek OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Brien is featured and plays some marvelous solos (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t That Just Like A WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne Room Country ShackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). The band cooks throughout. Effortless grooves on stuff like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoing Up The CountryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Lose Your CoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ show a very hot band that understands its music. Throw in some guest shots by the likes of David ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFatheadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Newman and Gary Primich, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got a wonderful musical journey.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nOmar Dykes - vocals, guitar; \nDerek O'Brien - guitar; \nCindy Cashdollar - lap steel guitar; \nGary Primich - harmonica; \nMark  Kazanoff - tenor &amp; baritone saxophones; \nDavid  Newman - tenor saxophone; \nGary Slechta - trumpet; \nNick Connolly - piano, organ; \nPaul Junior - bass; \nGeorge Rains - drums.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
