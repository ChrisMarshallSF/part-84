But when Mikey stumbles upon a treasure map of the famed \\&quot;One-Eyed\\&quot; Willy\\'s hidden fortune, Mikey, Brandon, and their friends Lawrence \\&quot;Chunk\\&quot; Cohen, Clark \\&quot;Mouth\\&quot; Devereaux, Andrea \\&quot;Andy\\&quot; Carmichael, Stefanie \\&quot;Stef\\&quot; Steinbrenner, and Richard \\&quot;Data\\&quot; Wang, calling themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest to find the treasure in hopes of saving their neighborhood. The treasure is in a cavern, but the entrance to the cavern is under the house of evil thief Mama Fratelli and her sons Jake Fratelli, Francis Fratelli, and the severely disfigured Lotney \\&quot;Sloth\\&quot; Fratelli. Sloth befriends the Goonies and decides to help them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a93130d3363e8e7ddee8263db2a155d241271c4","amp;dn":"The.Goonies.BluRay.720p.x264-SiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a93130d3363e8e7ddee8263db2a155d241271c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,147,19,13,51,99,232,231,221,238,130,99,219,42,21,93,36,18,113,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
