Since its inception in 2007, the project has been produced and engineered by Nashville producer and recording artist Kyle Andrews. Janis and Andrews first met in grade school and began trading demo cassette tapes in the mid-1990s.\n\nHorse In The SeaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Order The Sun To Shine On EveryoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released in December 2007 to critical acclaim. Substantiating reviews came from media outlets such as the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Reader, Time Out Chicago, and countless blogs. This modest self-release, recorded in the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basement, has sold over 15,000 downloads. The album singles, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVegasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Order The Sun,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ continue to receive airplay support from Chicago radio stations such as WXRT and Q101. Horse in the Sea has played over 200 shows in support of this album, including multiple sold-out performances in Chicago.\n\nThe band is currently working on their highly-anticipated 2010 release, entitled Grieve. Grieve is a conceptual sound recording based on people afflicted with and affected by psychological disorders.
