Formed in 1972 by Jimmy Carl Black (the Indian of the group) the band features other members of the group plus Tjay Contrelli formerly of Love. Features bonus track not on the original album. \n\n\nWhat can anyone say about the unique Jimmy Carl Black ex drummer and Indian of the group Mothers of Invention. Jimmy Black at his finest with a great lineup. The opening song &quot;Low Riding Man&quot; shows his Los Angeles influence, a nice tune that gets you moving with horns by the great ex Mothers Bunk Gardner and the very inovative ex &quot;Love&quot; member TJ Contrelli. A nice laid back tune &quot;Siesta&quot; with some very mellow flute stands out as does the song L.A. County Jail 59'which has TJ on vocals and horns in the story of the stay at LA's finest junkie hotel around. The song &quot;Other Man&quot; has some nice vocals and harmony from Denny Walley and Tom Leavey. you will notice some very distinct horn patterns reminiscent to the old Mothers sound, ala Bunk Gardner. Jimmy Carl Black has always been way ahead of his time in this project as well as The Grandmothers collection. A must for his fans of any era. \n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJimmy Carl Black - Drums &amp; Vocals\nBunk Gardner - All Woodwinds\nTom Leavy - Bass &amp; Vocals\nDenny Walley - Guitar &amp; Vocals\nTJay Contrelli - All Woodwinds &amp; Vocals\nAndy Cahan - Piano, Drums &amp; Vocals\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
