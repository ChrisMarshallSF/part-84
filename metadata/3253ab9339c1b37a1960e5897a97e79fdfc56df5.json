Deadliest Catch premiered in early 2005 and has been on air to this day. It chronicles the adventures of crabbers that work in the Bering Sea -- the Arctic body of water hugging Alaska's coast. Sound unexciting? Believe it or not, it isn't.\n\nThe competition between captains and crews to catch the most crab in a season is riveting, and things are only made more dramatic by the high-stakes nature of the job. After all, the money to be made in this industry is mind-boggling, as are the inherent dangers of the job. Indeed, crabbing in the Bering Sea is considered one of the most dangerous professions anywhere in the world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3253ab9339c1b37a1960e5897a97e79fdfc56df5","amp;dn":"Deadliest+Catch+Sea+of+Chaos+%5BUSA%5D%5BPS3%5D%5BEnglish%5D%5Bwww.consolasato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3253ab9339c1b37a1960e5897a97e79fdfc56df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,83,171,147,57,193,179,122,25,96,229,137,122,151,231,159,223,197,109,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
