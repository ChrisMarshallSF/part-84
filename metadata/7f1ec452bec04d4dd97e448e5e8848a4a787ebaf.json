I didn't call it Hang Cool in Manchester because of the lack of songs from that album. In fact this registration only has the performance of  'Song of Madness' from the Hang Cool album. The video is shot from the back of the arena balcony. Thanks to the many zooms it's still very watch able.  Sound is also ok for an audience recording. \n\nSet list:\n01 Hot Patootie\n02 Bat Out of Hell\n03 Audience Talk\n04 You Took the Words\n05 Song of Madness\n06 Rock and Roll Dreams\n07 Anything For Love\n08 Two Out of Three\n09 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n10 Dead Ringer for Love\n\nRunning TIme: 81 minutes\nPAL DVD\nStereo Sound\nChapters: Yes each song\nCover: Created and Included by me\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f1ec452bec04d4dd97e448e5e8848a4a787ebaf","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+in+Manchester+2010+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f1ec452bec04d4dd97e448e5e8848a4a787ebaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,30,196,82,190,192,77,77,217,126,68,142,94,136,72,164,167,135,235,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
