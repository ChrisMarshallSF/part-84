Ellen Page.\n\nTracey Berkowitz, 15, a self-described normal girl, loses her 9-year old brother, Sonny. In flashbacks and fragments, we meet her overbearing parents and the sweet, clueless Sonny. We watch Tracey navigate high school, friendless, picked on and teased. She develops a thing for Billy Zero, a new student, imagining he's her boyfriend. We see the day she loses Sonny and we watch her try to find him. In bits and pieces, we see what leads up to her riding in the back of a city bus wrapped in a shower curtain. Coming of age, or just surviving?\n\nSorry all you Icelandic, No subs in your language. Please unterstand me, it's just easier to mention Nordic, than name all the languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35865e32d56739ad1b954e6baaba1107a7594747","amp;dn":"The+Tracey+Fragments+%28Ellen+Page%29_ISO+%2F+Nordic+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35865e32d56739ad1b954e6baaba1107a7594747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,134,94,50,213,103,57,173,27,149,78,107,170,186,17,7,167,89,71,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
