Boh-Rok is incredibly temperamental and if angered, he will wreak havoc on the entire planet. He demands that anyone who approaches him follow strict guidelines. As a result, The Emperor tries to prepare Sheen for the impending visit by hiring a tutor. To sabotage Sheen, Dorkus enlists the worst possible tutor, a nervous, slug-like creature named Doppy. If Doppy can't get Sheen to stay focused and learn the protocol before Boh-Rok arrives, it could be the end of them both.\n\n    The Boy Next Dorkus: Dorkus's house is finally repaired, but to his shock, Sheen moves in right next to him.
