It starred Vanessa L. Williams as the Witch, the recorded voice of Judi Dench as the Giant, and cast including John McMartin (Narrator), Stephen DeRosa (the Baker), Gregg Edelman (Cinderella's Prince/Wolf), Christopher Sieber (Rapunzel's Prince/Wolf), Molly Ephraim (Little Red Riding Hood), and Laura Benanti (Cinderella).\n\nThe plot was retooled, with a subplot added involving a cameo appearance of the Three Little Pigs restored from the earlier San Diego production.[8][9] Other changes included the addition of the song &quot;Our Little World,&quot; a duet between the Witch and Rapunzel that was part of the London production; Jack's cow was a puppet with a live performer, Chad Kimball, inside who dances; &quot;The Last Midnight&quot; was sung by the Witch as a menacing lullaby to the Baker's baby held hostage.[9] There were two Wolves rather than only one, sung by the two performers who also play the Princes, symbolic of their insatiable appetites.\n\nThe revival won the Tony Awards for the Best Revival of a Musical and Best Lighting Design.[10] This Broadway revival wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in South Florida.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06875424b3541831198fc0a05ab188bf34f18ad4","amp;dn":"Broadway+-+Into+The+Woods+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06875424b3541831198fc0a05ab188bf34f18ad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,135,84,36,179,84,24,49,25,143,192,160,90,177,136,191,52,241,138,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
