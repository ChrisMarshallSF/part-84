The LiveCD mode lets you try PCLInuxOS without making any changes to your computer. If you like it, you can install the operating system to your hard drive. Locally installed versions of PCLinuxOS utilize the Advanced Packaging Tool (or APT), a package management system (originally from the Debian distribution), together with Synaptic, a GUI frontend to APT for easy software installation. PCLinuxOS has over 12,000 rpm software packages available from our software repository.\n\nPCLinuxOS has a script called mylivecd, which allows the user to take a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“snapshotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of their current hard drive installation (all settings, applications, documents, etc.) and compress it into an ISO CD/DVD image. This allows easy backup of a userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s data and also makes it easy to create your own custom live CD/DVD.\n\nPCLinuxOS has additional support for over 85 language through our simple Addlocale interface.\n\nPCLinuxOS is safe and secure.
