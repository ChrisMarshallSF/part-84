Also, everyone has inanimate objects instead of heads for some reason.\n\nWe made a pilot episode with no budget in order to raise money for a whole season. Instead of pitching it to a TV network, we're pitching it to you. Yes, YOU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGo to http://www.yfias.com to find out more, and contribute to our Kickstarter project so we can produce a full season!\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f239b5c12f4dd7088310d8326ee3a314cb092260","amp;dn":"Your+Face+is+a+Saxophone+--+Episode+1+--+Pilot+--+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f239b5c12f4dd7088310d8326ee3a314cb092260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,57,181,193,47,77,215,8,131,16,216,50,110,227,163,20,203,9,34,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
