Cabin Fever stars Rider Strong as the geeky Paul, who hopes to settle in around the campfire with his brash buds Jeff (Joey Kern) and Bert (James DeBello), and make the moves on the nubile-but-shy Karen (Jordan Ladd). Unfortunately, a wayward, forest-dwelling vagrant (Arie Verveen) stumbles into their lives, his skin badly desiccated by a mysterious virus. Fearing for their own lives, the quintet decide to do away with the man, with little success: He stumbles away from the campsite and into a nearby stream, where his disease quickly infects the local water supply. It isn't long before the oblivious co-eds get a taste of the man's illness, and in their desperation, each learns that he or she will stop at nothing to survive. Cabin Fever premiered at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, where it was snapped up by Lions Gate for a fall 2003 release. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c75194778f8e1d63016f9768f8bfb4735384096","amp;dn":"Cabin+Fever%282002%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c75194778f8e1d63016f9768f8bfb4735384096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,117,25,71,120,248,225,214,48,22,249,118,143,139,251,71,53,56,64,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
