In The UFO Diaries, Martin tells the story of his journey to uncover the story behind UFOs - first sightings, recent sightings, believers, non-believers, and, strangest of all, the abductees. Told in the style of the best and funniest travel memoirs, it is a hugely entertaining jaunt around the world. Plowman travels first to Roswell, New Mexico, the site of the first UFO sighting, which is now home to the biggest and best UFO museum. He then heads to the Andes, where modern-day UFO 'contactees' - ufologists who wait for aliens to send a message rather than actively recording and collecting UFO reports - have taken root among the high desert valleys of Chile. In Mexico City, he finds that everyone is a believer and UFOs are as common as saints and just as everyday. Back in Australia he travels around the country to meet abductees, confused and often frightened people who are scorned by the Ufologists. Finally he heads to the UK to try to uncover the secrets of crop circles. The UFO Diaries is funny, weird and, like its subject, out there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700d9115749e803096ace1d5d9bc6f9bce59533c","amp;dn":"Martin+Plowman+-+The+UFO+Diaries+%282011%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700d9115749e803096ace1d5d9bc6f9bce59533c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,13,145,21,116,158,128,48,150,172,225,213,217,188,111,155,206,89,83,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
