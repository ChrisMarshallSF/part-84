Only the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmain characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the game can survive until the end ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but who is the main character?  And, perhaps more importantly, who is controlling the game?\nProject notes:\nI captured the video from my laserdisc (see scans below).  This was my first ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œseriousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ attempt at video cleanup, and it turned out to be unusually difficult.  My ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œusualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ methods that I developed only later really didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work well here.  I had a lot of trouble with artifacts, but I got most of them cleaned up.  There is still a problem with anti-aliasing in some scenes, which was introduced during the (imperfect) deinterlace.  But I swear, this is cleaned up as much as I am able with my current level of experience.  Perhaps I need to defeat some AV Expers.\nThe script was timed by &quot;inactive,&quot; who also arranged for the translation, and I did a lot of script editing.  Unfortunately, I lost contact with inactive, so I am now proceeding on my own.\nI do not currently consider the script to be 100%.  There are some segments that are a bit weird, and the ending song is not translated or even romanized, which I strongly prefer.  But I never had any direct access to the translator who worked on this, and my contact who I was originally working with on this has vanished for now.  I hope someday I can get somebody to help me correct these faults.\nAVISynth script (video 4.0):\nAVISource(ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œZenonRECAP-LAGARITH.aviÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½)\nTDeint(mode=2, mtnmode=1, blim=100, type=1, sharp=true, denoise=true, tryWeave=true, slow=2)\ncrop(6,0,-12,0)\nSpline64Resize(640,480)\nFFT3DFilter(sigma=3.0, plane=4, bw=48, bh=48, bt=4, ow=16, oh=16, sharpen=0, interlaced=false)\nvmToon()","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:545115d46fa1b7e2c7f7cbf26903a27ded68f05e","amp;dn":"Exper+Zenon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"545115d46fa1b7e2c7f7cbf26903a27ded68f05e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,81,21,212,111,161,183,226,199,247,203,242,105,3,162,125,237,104,240,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
