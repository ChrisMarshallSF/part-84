They were formed in 1989 by Liam Kelly, Shane Mitchell, Martin McGinley, Brian McDonagh and Michael Holmes. The band was originally formed to record an album of local music which was later released as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Boys of SligoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. They later formed Dervish. The name was chosen as it relates to groups of spiritual people who are enraptured by music.History\n\nIn 1991 the band were joined by Roscommon-born singer Cathy Jordan and all-Ireland champion fiddle player Shane McAleer. DervishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHarmony HillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was released in 1992 to critical success. In 1994 their second album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlaying with FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was released and reached number 1 in the Irish Folk Music and international World/Roots music charts. In 1996 Dervish released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAt the End of the DayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which won the Hot Press Folk Album of the Year Award.\n\nTheir fourth album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive in PalmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was recorded in front of a live audience at Palma de Majorca's Theatre Principal in April 1997 and received critical acclaim. In the same year the readers of Irish Music Magazine awarded Dervish Best Overall Trad/Folk Band of the Year. In 1998 Shane McAleer left the band and was replaced by well-known Sligo musician, SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©amus O'Dowd and All-Ireland Champion fiddle player Tom Morrow from County Leitrim. The seven piece line-up were now Cathy Jordan (vocals, bodhrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, bones), Tom Morrow (fiddle, viola), Shane Mitchell (accordion), Liam Kelly (flute, low whistle), SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©amus O'Dowd (guitars, harmonica), Michael Holmes (bouzouki) and Brian McDonagh (mandola, mandolin). Dervish's fifth album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMidsummer's NightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, released in 1999, was voted Irish Trad Album of the Year.\n\nIn 2001 Dervish released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDecadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a compilation of tracks from their first five albums. In 2003 they released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, followed by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Healing HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 2006.\n\nIn 2003 Sligo City Council bestowed the Freedom of the Borough of Sligo on the band for their international artistic achievements and their dedication to and promotion of their local heritage.\n\nIn 2005 The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Mr Bertie Ahern invited Dervish to accompany him on an Irish trade mission to China. In 2006 Dervish accompanied Irish President Mary McAleese on her State Visits to Latvia and Lithuania and performed a special concert in the Great Hall of Latvia Society House in Riga for President McAleese and President Vike-Freiberga of Latvia. On 24 May they will give a concert in Vilnius in honour of President Adamkus of Lithuania.\n\nOn November 14, 2006, the Irish national broadcaster RTÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â° announced that Dervish were to perform the Irish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Dervish finished last with five points, awarded to them from the Albanian back up jury due to a failed televote, for their performance of &quot;They Can't Stop The Spring&quot;.\n\nIn October 2007 Dervish released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTravelling ShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, partly produced by John Reynolds.\n\n\n\n\nThis DVD is from a show from 1996 when Dervish was promoting their second CD, &quot;Playing With Fire&quot;. Nine of the tunes and songs are from that CD. The other five are from &quot;Harmony Hill&quot;. It is very nicely taped and quite enjoyable. \n\nHere is the group line-up at that time: \n\nCathy Jordan - vocals, bodhrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, bones \nLiam Kelly - flute \nShane Mitchell - accordian \nShane McAleer - fiddle \nBrian McDonagh - mandola, mandolin \nMichael Holmes - bouzouki \n\nThe DVD label is a bit of a mess. Here are the correct titles. Tracks 13 and 14 are part of the same tune set. \n\n1. Rathlin Island, The Graf Spee, Last Night's Fun \n2. Peigin Mo Chroi \n3. My Mind Will Never Be Easy, The Cock And The Hen, The Ash Plant \n4. Maire Mhor \n5. The Victory, The Game Of Love, The Cloon \n6. The Hungry Rock \n7. A Stor Mo Chroi \n8. The Fair Maid \n9.
