When Jack is forced to leave Vegas, he packs up his old Cadillac and hits the road for Atlantic City. But his car dies in the desert and Jack is left stranded in the small town of Lost Springs. There, Jack meets jazz legend turned mechanic, Doc Bishop (Robert Guillaume), who helps him with his car trouble. Although Jack is far from the stage, he begins to find himself feeling at home in the small town. When he meets dreamy eyed bartender, Lauren Wells (Melissa Joan Hart), Jack starts to see there is more to life than chasing fame and fortune. Doc encourages Jack to explore his true love of music, while Lauren provides the audience he has always wanted. But as Jack realizes this town has more to offer him than the bright lights of the big city, his Vegas past catches up with him what unfolds is comedy at the crossroads of life. \n\nCats :\nHamilton von Watts \t... \tJack Satin\nMelissa Joan Hart \t... \tLauren Wells\nRobert Guillaume \t... \tDoc\nAlley Mills \t... \tRose Wells\nPerry Anzilotti \t... \tFranco Franzo\nChip Bent \t... \tAuto\nMichael Cudlitz \t... \tKip Tanner\nJackie Debatin \t... \tHeaven Carrera\nBingo Dinh \t... \tLittle Mo\nCallie Fenoglio \t... \tLana Price\nCal Gibson \t... \tDon Williams\nAl Harrington \t... \tChief One Horn\nStephen Keys \t... \tBuddy Ludwig\nVictor Rivers \t... \tStyles Fontane\nRichard Romero \t... \tDel Blitz \n\nData Technical :\n!!!
