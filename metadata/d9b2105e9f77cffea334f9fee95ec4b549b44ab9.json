The narration alternates between a female (Romane Bohringer) and a male (Charles Berling) narrator speaking the alternate roles of the female and male penguin, and as the chicks are born their narration is handled by a child actor Jules Sitruk.\n\nIn contrast, the English language release has a third-person narrative by a single voice, actor Morgan Freeman.\n\nIf you searching for corrupt version with narrator is Morgan Freeman, try here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4498096/March.Of.The.Penguins.2005.720p.HDDVD.x264-REVEiLLE\n\n\nThis version have first-person EN subtitles, just select the French DTS audio track from player menu and english subs.\n\nAlso this version have original totaly different French audio track\n\niMDB URL........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428803/\niMDB RATiNG.....: 7.8/10 (19,061 votes)\nGENRE...........: Documentary\nSOURCE TYPE.....: Blu-ray\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 r957 L4.1 @6422Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 25.000 fps\n\nAUDiO BiTRATE1...: DTS@768kbps (French)\nAUDiO BiTRATE2...: AC3@384kbps (Russian)\n\n(russian audio track from here:\n\nRUNTiME.........: 85 mins\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.85 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1280 x 692\nLANGUAGE........: Russian / French\nSUBTiTLES.......: English, Bulgarian, Russian\nVideo and French track RiPPER...: redthorm@CHD\n\nscreenshots: http://img607.imageshack.us/g/grab004304.png/\n\nSubtitles in ASS format\n(russian subs from here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b2105e9f77cffea334f9fee95ec4b549b44ab9","amp;dn":"March+of+the+Penguins+2005%2C+x264%2C+720p+%28rus%2Cfra+audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b2105e9f77cffea334f9fee95ec4b549b44ab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,178,16,94,159,119,207,254,163,52,249,254,233,94,196,181,73,180,74,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
