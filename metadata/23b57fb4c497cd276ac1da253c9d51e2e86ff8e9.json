Untreated,       \n         its bite has a fatality rate of 100 percent, making it a      \n         killer among killers on a continent where it is thought       \n         that nearly 20,000 people die of snake bites each year,       \n         and the residents of Swaziland in southern Africa have        \n         suffered losses for generations. With essentially no          \n         access to anti-venom, many people turn to traditional         \n         healers for help, but their herbal remedies always fail,      \n         leaving Swazis feeling fearful and defenseless against        \n          one of their nation's most infamous killers.                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                          ORENJI, 2HD, DHD, CTU                        \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
