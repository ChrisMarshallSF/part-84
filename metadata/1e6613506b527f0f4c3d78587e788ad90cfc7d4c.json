These 2005 sessions are a relaxing affair that will delight fans of Brazilian jazz. Joined by bassist Ira Coleman and drummer Thierry Arpino (who is known for his work with violinist Jean-Luc Ponty), Beck's fluid electric guitar (while sometimes overdubbing an acoustic rhythm line) makes the most of each selection, playing a heavy dose of popular tunes by Antonio Carlos Jobim and his own tasty originals. Highlights among the Jobim compositions include the bittersweet &quot;O Grande Amor&quot; and the easygoing &quot;Felicidade.&quot; Harmonica player Gregoire Maret is added for the leader's gentle bossa nova &quot;And Here's to You&quot; and Jobim's bittersweet &quot;Falando De Amor.&quot; Beck also offers an inventive samba arrangement of John Coltrane's &quot;Giant Steps&quot; that adds a few twists while played at a slower-than-typical tempo, so it sneaks up on the listener.
