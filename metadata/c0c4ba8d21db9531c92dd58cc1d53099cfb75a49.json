The detective freely admit that they have little experience with this type of case, but the family wants them for two reasons - they're not cops and they know the tough neighborhood in which they all live. As the case progresses, Kenzie and Gennaro face drug dealers, gangs and pedophiles. When they are about to solve their case, they are faced with a moral dilemma that could tear them apart.\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452623/\nGenre: Crime | Drama | Mystery | Thriller\n::General:: \n\nFormat: Mpeg-2 Transport Stream\nFile size: 3.99Gb\nDuration: 1h 54mn\n \n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: h.264 \nAverage video bitrate: 4.3 Mbps\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1\nResolution: 1920x1080\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: Ac3\nBitrate: 640 kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c4ba8d21db9531c92dd58cc1d53099cfb75a49","amp;dn":"Gone.Baby.Gone.%282007%29.1080p.AC3.5.1ch.Blu-ray.PS3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c4ba8d21db9531c92dd58cc1d53099cfb75a49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,196,186,141,33,219,149,49,201,45,213,140,193,213,48,153,207,183,90,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
