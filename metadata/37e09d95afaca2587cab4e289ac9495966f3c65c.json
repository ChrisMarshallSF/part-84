It was the first album to be recorded at their new California studio, Shangri-La and the first album of all-new material since 1971's Cahoots. \n\nIn many respects Northern Lights - Southern Cross was viewed as a comeback. The album was the Band's finest since their self-titled sophomore effort.\n\nAll eight songs are credited as compositions of guitarist Robbie Robertson.\n\nNorthern Lights - Southern Cross was recorded using a 24-track console, allowing Garth Hudson to include multiple layers of keyboards and to explore new timbres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nRobbie Robertson , Guitar (Acoustic) / Guitar / Piano / Guitar (Electric) / Keyboards / Vocals / Clavinet / Melodica / Producer / Guitar (Acoustic) / Mixing \n\nRick Danko , Bass / Harmonica / Violin / Guitar (Electric) / Vocals / Producer / Mixing \n\nByron Berline , Fiddle / Violin \n\nLevon Helm , Guitar / Drums / Vocals / Producer \n\nGarth Hudson , Organ / Synthesizer / Bass / Accordion / Keyboards / Piccolo / Saxophone / Sax (Soprano) / Brass / Chant / Woodwind / Mixing\n\nRichard Manuel , Piano / Conga / Drums / Keyboards / Organ (Hammond) / Piano (Electric) / Vocals / Clavinet / Producer \n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
