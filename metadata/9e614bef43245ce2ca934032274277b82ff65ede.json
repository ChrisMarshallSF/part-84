It was a world of dark forests and Viking adventures in which fear was real and death a constant companion. People felt they walked hand-in-hand with God, and envisaged him so literally that even Christians were sometimes buried with supplies for the journey to the new life in heaven. Narrated through the progression of the seasons, this book presents a recreation of English life at the end of the first millennium AD.\n\n\nThe authors\n\nRobert Lacey is an internationally renowned historian and biographer. Danny Danziger is a journalist and interviewer for THE INDEPENDENT and SUNDAY TIMES magazine. He is co-founder, along with Robert Lacey, of COVER magazine.\n\n\nThe reader\n\nSir Derek George Jacobi, CBE (born 22 October 1938) is an English actor and film director.\n\nA &quot;forceful, commanding stage presence&quot;, Jacobi has enjoyed a highly successful stage career, appearing in such stage productions as Hamlet, Uncle Vanya, and Oedipus the King.
