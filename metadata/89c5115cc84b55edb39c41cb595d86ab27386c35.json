The screenplay by Charles Beaumont and Ray Russell was based upon the tale, The Premature Burial by American author Edgar Allan Poe. The film was directed by Roger Corman, is the third in his series of eight Poe film adaptations, and the only one in the series not starring Vincent Price. The film won one award.\n\nPlot\n====\nGuy Carrell (Ray Milland) is a tormented man who believes his father was entombed alive after suffering a cataleptic attack. In order to avoid a similar fate, he constructs a special tomb that will allow him to escape. In an attempt to allay her husband's fears, Emily Carrell (Hazel Court) encourages Guy to open his father's tomb to determine whether the elder man died peacefully. When the tomb is opened, Guy's worst suspicions are realized and he falls into a cataleptic seizure. The doctors determine Guy has died of a heart attack and he is buried alive.\n\nCast\n====\n    * Ray Milland as Guy Carrell\n    * Heather Angel as Kate Carrell, Guys sister\n    * Hazel Court as Emily Gault, Guys wife\n    * Alan Napier as Dr. Gideon Gault\n    * Richard Ney as Miles Archer\n    * John Dierkes as Sweeney\n    * Dick Miller as Mole\n    * Clive Halliday as Judson\n    * Brendan Dillon as Clergyman\n\nReception\n=========\nCavett Binion in Allmovie notes: Millands performance conveys the requisite amount of hand-wringing torment (in the mode of The Lost Weekend), even if he fails to capture the manic intensity that Price brought to the other Poe films. Cormans deft direction, employing a rich palette of colors and superb widescreen compositions, is on a par with the series finest installments.\n\n...................................................................................\n\nThis file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player. \nJust burn the files onto a CD using Nero or Ashampoo Buring Studio by making a DATA CD.\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player \n                       (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC.\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
