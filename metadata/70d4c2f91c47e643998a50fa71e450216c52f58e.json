And in a world that\nincreasingly doesn't care, maybe just simply relying on\nfriendship is not enough? Especially with friends like Billy,\nSean and Tommy. Set amongst the backdrop of the towering,\nconcrete-clad estates of south London 'Zebra Crossings' blends\na diverse mixture of characters that all share one thing in\ncommon: The incredible loneliness of living alongside 7 million\nother people. Blending the surreal, and very real, we take an\nintense journey in search of friendship, belief and religion.\nWith a lacklustre father and estranged mother, Justin's only\nsource of perennial control comes from an unlikely source, his\nbed-ridden sister Suzanne. But Justin needs is a real mentor, a\nfather figure, someone who can provide guidance before it's all\ntoo late. In steps Marcus, unlike anyone Justin has ever known\nbefore, calm, soft, assured - but does he want something from\nJustin? Meanwhile, Tommy's abandonment issues haunt him once\nagain, and his class-A drug addiction has sent him into full\ndestruction mode. Also, the pressure from a rival gang has\nreached exploding point - as there is certainly no space for\ntwo crews in this neighbourhood. Justin must find the answer\nto it all, and quick. \n\n\n\nScreen: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/7122/sampleavisnapshot000120.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/7122/sampleavisnapshot000120.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/5727/sampleavisnapshot005420.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/5727/sampleavisnapshot005420.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/497/sampleavisnapshot020020.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/497/sampleavisnapshot020020.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70d4c2f91c47e643998a50fa71e450216c52f58e","amp;dn":"Zebra+Crossing+2011+DVDRip+XviD-ViP3R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70d4c2f91c47e643998a50fa71e450216c52f58e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,212,194,249,28,71,230,67,153,138,80,250,113,228,80,33,108,82,245,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
