Snagit 10 provides a smarter and more efficient way to grab your images, with updated capture profiles and effects to improve how you capture, edit, share and organize your content.\n\nTop 3 features in Snagit 10\n\nAll-in-One Capture-Snag anything, on the fly. Use the newest capture profile to grab your entire desktop, a region, a window, or a scrolling windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all with a single hotkey or click.\n\nUpdated Transparency-Now you can keep the rounded corners from a captured windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ or create a custom shapeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and the only background youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see is the one on your website, document, or slide.\n\nUpload to Screencast.com-ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easier than ever to send your captures out for review with built-in, online hosting from Screencast.com. Now you can share your images with an embed code or give them a URL with a clickable thumbnail. Store, share and gather feedback on all of your visual projects.\n\n\nSmarter capture options\n\nImproved Auto-Scroll\n\nSnagitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s auto-scroll feature has drastically improved and can now sense when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re on a web page that scrolls. Snagit will automatically move through the pageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ capturing it both vertically and horizontallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ at your command. Just point and click.\n\n\nUpdated Magnifier\n\nLike a microscope for your computer screenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ use magnified cross hairs to get exact, down-to-the-pixel precision on every capture.\nFormatted Text Capture\n\nPerfect for reviewing text and making changesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½grab the text straight off a web page and keep the formattingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½then edit and apply different font styles, sizes and colors.\n\nNew possibilities\n\nCut-Out Effect\n\nStylishly delete unwanted pieces of an image by removing vertical and horizontal sections. Add a background image to fill the gap, or make it transparent.\n\nPage Curl Effect\n\nMake your image look as if one of the corners is folded over for an eye-grabbing effect. Pick from one of the preset page curl options, or create your own.\n\nWindows System Requirements\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP*, Windows Vista*, or Windows 7*.\n1.0 GHz processor ~ Recommended: 2.4 GHz\n512 MB of RAM ~ Recommended: 1 GB or more\n60 MB of hard-disk space for program installation\nInternet Explorer 7.0 or later required\n\n\nAll my uploads are for those people who cannot afford to buy them,who don't have credit cards and the product is not available in the market.\n\n                            Kkeibul","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb8e8ddaa24125ab22e7b040f8a1c55ee75fead9","amp;dn":"Snagit+10%28latest+version%29Kkeibul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb8e8ddaa24125ab22e7b040f8a1c55ee75fead9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,142,141,218,162,65,37,171,34,231,176,64,248,161,197,94,231,95,234,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
