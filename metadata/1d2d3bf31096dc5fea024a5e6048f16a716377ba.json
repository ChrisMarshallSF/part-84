These are the key ingredients of this over-the-top gross-out fest about the worst guesthouse in Britain. Former Young Ones star Rik Mayall is Richie Twat (pronounced \\\\\\&quot;Thwaite\\\\\\&quot; as he labors to explain to one and all) who runs the titular hotel with his dull-witted cohort Eddie (Adrian Edmondson). Balancing precariously on a cliff overlooking a nuclear power plant, the hotel is a nightmare from the standpoint of customer service. Richie gleefully abuses the guests, rummages through their luggage, and serves them vile, rotten food. When a nice but impoverished family and an Italian starlet (Gina \\\\\\&quot;Nipples from Naples\\\\\\&quot; Carbonara, played by Helene Mahieau) makes the mistake of staying at their abode, events grow more bizarre and scatological with each passing frame until the film\\\\\\'s delirious finale, which has to be the one of the longest and most involved mass puking scenes ever committed to celluloid.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d2d3bf31096dc5fea024a5e6048f16a716377ba","amp;dn":"Adrian+Edmondson+-+Guest+House+Paradiso+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d2d3bf31096dc5fea024a5e6048f16a716377ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,45,59,243,16,150,220,95,234,2,74,94,96,72,241,106,113,99,119,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
