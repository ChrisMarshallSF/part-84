New DCI John Barnaby is intrigued when\n                he learns that the remains of famous racing driver\n                Duncan Palmer have been discovered at Darnley Park\n                School - 40 years after he was thought to have\n                drowned in the Lake District. During the school's\n                classic car show, racing legend Peter Fossett is\n                annoyed that his fellow judge is club DJ Dave 'Doggy'\n                Day, who knows nothing about cars. Soon afterwards,\n                Doggy is crushed to death under a classic car and\n                Barnaby thinks the video diaries of two pupils could\n                hold clues to the killing. Then a new lead takes him\n                to meet someone at the barn where Duncan Palmer met\n                his death. When the killer turns on him, could\n                Barnaby's first case also be his last?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cec41c4c29d77a6c2ac478594f24af4e3c448f5","amp;dn":"Midsomer.Murders.S14E01.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cec41c4c29d77a6c2ac478594f24af4e3c448f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,236,65,196,194,157,119,166,194,172,71,133,148,242,74,244,227,196,72,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
