As she journeys, a number of characters are introduced.\nThere is Henry's sister, Teresa, an exotic dancer.\nThere is Teresa and Henry's father, Dodge, an ex-con who gives his son the most baffling of advice and has a strange fixation on bones.\nThere is Nick's patient, Aldo, a gangster who can get Nick his money ... but only by roping him into participating in a heist.\nThere is a bartender named Camilla, who is having relationship problems with her divorced upstairs neighbor.\nThere is June, a hatcheck girl for an exclusive nude ping pong club.\nThere is Francine's superior, Sam Salazar, who is always addressed as Officer but is actually a detective.\nThen there is Francine's ex-husband, Emmit, who has something Francine wants.\n\nProduction\n\nGirl Walks Into a Bar is produced by GutiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rrez's Gato Negro Films and co-produced by Zach Schwartz's Shangri-La Entertainment.\nPrincipal photography took place in Los Angeles in March 2010.
