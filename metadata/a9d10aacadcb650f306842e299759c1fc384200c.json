Chaired by Richard Lindley.\n\nArguing for the motion are Professor Avi Shlaim, Professor Jacqueline Rose, and Amira Hass.\n\nAvi Shlaim rejects the Zionist colonial project beyond the 1967 border, and states that Israel's occupation of Palestine has transformed Zionism from a legitimate national liberation movement to an ideology of ultra-nationalist settlers. He warns that a lot of people are upset and angry with Israel for its treatment towards Palestinians.\n\nJacqueline Rose points out that Zionism is a movement that has always been reinterpreted from within. On the subject of displacement of Palestinians, Rose asks how the creation of a nation on the back of another society cannot be dangerous for Jews themselves.\n\nAmira Hass says she does not believe in such generalising statements as the motion in hand. However, she discusses the reality of life in Israel and uses her own experiences to paint a picture of the practical, if not legal, separation of Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nArguing against the motion are Melanie Phillips, Shlomo Ben-Ami and Professor Raphael Israeli.\n\nMelanie Phillips says the motion wrongly suggests that Jews have no enemy but themselves. She questions whether the behaviour of Israel or the ideology of Zionism are malign. She refutes the charges made against the actions of Israel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ expansion in 1967 was, in her view, not an act of aggression.\n\nShlomo Ben-Ami states that Israel is in a circumstantial conflict, and that the historical realities it faces were predicaments that most European nations have faced. He points out that Britain, France and Belgium set precedents for any repression that has since been used by Israel, and notes that it took Europe endless wars to end its nationalist disputes.\n\nRaphael Israeli says there has so far been little mention of Zionism, with the previous speakers concentrating on Israel. He points out that Zionism is an ideology and Israel is a state. In his view, Zionism has enjoyed spectacular success, but all we hear of are various demonisations.\n\nFirst Vote: 228 For, 227 Against, 291 Don't Know\n\nFinal Vote: 355 For, 320 Against, 40 Don't Know\n\nThe motion is passed by 35 votes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d10aacadcb650f306842e299759c1fc384200c","amp;dn":"Zionism+today+is+the+real+enemy+of+the+Jews+-+Debate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d10aacadcb650f306842e299759c1fc384200c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,209,10,172,173,203,101,15,48,104,66,226,153,117,156,31,195,132,32,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
