It's called Creeper Lagoon, and a strange fact about this band is that almost nobody has heard of it.  I think it is because of some dire family curse from five hundred years ago, or something...  \n:)\nAnyway, like I said I could not find everything!!  The latest EP from the band is being impossible.  It's called Remember the Future, and if your can help me find it then please drop me a link.\n\nMost of the rest of their stuff is here.  \n\n-I Become Small and Go\n-Watering Ghost Garden\n-Take Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday\n\nIf you download this and love it, remember that it doesn't hurt anybody to track down the actual albums and give it a buy.  Well, except for punching you in the bank account for eleven bucks.
