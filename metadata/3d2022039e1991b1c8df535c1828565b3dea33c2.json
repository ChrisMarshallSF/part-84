He finds a generation that has shed the moderate Islam their parents brought to this country, and instead have adopted a faith that they believe compels them to stand apart from Britain and its values.\n- http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qt1pm\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 467 MiB\nDuration                         : 59mn 3s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 106 Kbps\n\n*****\nSeed and share alike!\n- RDimH.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d2022039e1991b1c8df535c1828565b3dea33c2","amp;dn":"Generation+Jihad+Episode+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d2022039e1991b1c8df535c1828565b3dea33c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,32,34,3,158,25,145,177,200,223,83,92,24,40,86,91,61,234,51,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
