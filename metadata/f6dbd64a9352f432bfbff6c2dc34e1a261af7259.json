During his campaign, however, he's tracked by a veteran cop and an egocentric hit man. \n\nNOTE: Another example of misleading IMDB rating, I haven't expected much, but movie is excellent. Engaging, with fantastic cast: Mr. Thornton perfect as ever, Ms. Gugino convincing and great, Dwayne shows great acting. Honestly, I don't know who have not delivered. Even Ms. Capenter in very small role gives great authenticity...\nGood &quot;revenge&quot; movie - recommended.\n\nSubtitles: Croatian and English, external","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6dbd64a9352f432bfbff6c2dc34e1a261af7259","amp;dn":"Faster.2010.BluRay.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6dbd64a9352f432bfbff6c2dc34e1a261af7259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,219,214,74,147,82,244,50,191,191,246,194,220,52,225,162,97,175,114,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
