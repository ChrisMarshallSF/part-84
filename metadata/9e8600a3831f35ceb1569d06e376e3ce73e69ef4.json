Paxton and support from musicians like pedal steel guitarist Pete Drake and fiddler Doug Kershaw, it features a more traditional Nashville sound combined with psychedelic touches courtesy of a Moog synthesizer and sound effects. While some people might cringe at the very notion of the latter elements, I feel that they are used judiciously and enhance the performances instead of overwhelming them. Legend can best be appreciated as an artistic statement from a supremely talented sideman whose experiences with the music industry have left him disenchanted, to say the very least. Griggs wrote the impressive lyrics for every song and delivers them with a voice that at times recalls the singing of Gram Parsons or Willie Nelson. &quot;Fabulous Body and Smile,&quot; &quot;Keep It Country,&quot; and the poignant &quot;Clint Texas&quot; all sound like his observations on the record-making business and country music in general, while &quot;West Coast Billy,&quot; &quot;Sing My Old Songs to Somebody New,&quot; &quot;A Sideman Talks to God,&quot; and &quot;Country Soul&quot; come off as eloquent autobiographical pieces. My favorite cut, &quot;Singing for the Lord&quot; is the LPs hardest-rocking moment and seems to mock those who inordinately profit from performing religious material. &quot;Vhi-Vhamp-Thieu,&quot; &quot;In L.A.,&quot; and &quot;Uncle Ned&quot; respectively comment on the early 1970s conflicts in Vietnam and Cambodia, Griggs's experiences in southern California, and the drug culture of the time. &quot;Cricket Conversation Interlude,&quot; &quot;Moogie Woogie,&quot; &quot;Birds,&quot; &quot;Heartbeats and Death Gasp,&quot; and &quot;Freak-out Moog&quot; are brief electronic pieces that serve as bridges in between some of the longer performances. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e8600a3831f35ceb1569d06e376e3ce73e69ef4","amp;dn":"Sir+Robert+Charles+Griggs+-+The+Legend+Of+%281973%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e8600a3831f35ceb1569d06e376e3ce73e69ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,134,0,163,131,31,53,206,177,86,157,6,227,118,227,206,115,230,158,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
