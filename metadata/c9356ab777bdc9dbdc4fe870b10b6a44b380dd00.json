Their stories are about tenderness, excess, and self-destruction. About the search for happiness and the fear of being alone. The portrait in 19 conversations, 56 nights, and 13 tracks. \n\nBerlin 2005: Techno has returned underground ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and lives more excessively than ever. And once again the city has become the place to be for those who want to go all the way. \n\n&quot;Feiern&quot; shows them getting down ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sweaty, dazed, deliriously happy. People who dedicate their lives to music, clubs and drugs talk about their experiences.They tell stories of self-destruction as well as tenderness. And every one of them is about the search for happiness: about that perfect moment of collective ecstasy, about the right record being played at the right time, about talking for eight hours to a complete stranger, who you adopt as your best friend ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for the night. Or about how it feels to walk into a darkroom and become &quot;a mere piece of meat, to be used and use others&quot;. The conversations add up to the portrait of a family and make &quot;Feiern&quot; the melancholic homage to a subculture that continues to celebrate until, finally, a simple cough turns into pneumonia, and a blackout leads to psychosis. In Berlin, says Ewan Pearson, a DJ and producer from London, somebody could bang a wooden spoon on a saucepan- as long as you did it in time, nobody would go home. With a smile he advises his friends: &quot;DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forget to go home!&quot;. They might not. And rave on happily ever after.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9356ab777bdc9dbdc4fe870b10b6a44b380dd00","amp;dn":"FEIERN+-+Don%5C%27t+Forget+To+Go+Home%21+%28DVD%2BCD%29+%5Bbirdfeiern%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9356ab777bdc9dbdc4fe870b10b6a44b380dd00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,53,106,183,119,189,201,219,220,79,232,112,177,11,106,68,179,128,221,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
