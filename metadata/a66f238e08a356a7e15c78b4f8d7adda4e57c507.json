I present a program that I've developed to\ncreate channel lists ps3 to our liking.\nThe program already has a list of channels to add, but otherwise there is an option to put our\nchannels or web pages you want!\nThe only creates our file xil.xml to put directly into our ps3\n(/dev_hdd0/tmp/explore/xil/tv/c/63431223453538546/xil.xml). Suitable for all the CFW or dongles\nas you only need an FTP or file manager.\nThe icons and the backgrounds are the same as the pack of colchonerox! I hope you find it useful!\nPS: If you have any problems or want to add channels to the next version reply in the thread,\nthanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66f238e08a356a7e15c78b4f8d7adda4e57c507","amp;dn":"PS3+Channels+Creator+v1.0+Homebrew+Application","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66f238e08a356a7e15c78b4f8d7adda4e57c507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,111,35,142,8,163,86,167,225,92,120,180,248,215,173,218,78,87,197,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
