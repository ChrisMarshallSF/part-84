The album was met with heavy criticism, not only for its performancesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½most of which were angry spoken-word tirades that Souljah screamed rather than traditional hip-hop rhymesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but also because of its controversial lyrics. The two singles and music videos, &quot;The Hate that Hate Produced&quot; and &quot;The Final Solution: Slavery's Back in Effect,&quot; were banned by MTV because of their inflammatory language and imagery.[citation needed] The album made it to #72 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop album chart, selling a mere 27,000 copies. Guest appearances were made by Chuck D (&quot;State of Accommodation: Why Aren't You Angry&quot;) and Ice Cube (&quot;Killing Me Softly: Deadly Code of Silence&quot;). One track, &quot;Wild Buck Beer,&quot; a fictional commercial for a malt liquor, features an appearance by an anonymous artist under the moniker MC Just Want to Get Paid.\n Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;African Scaredy Katz in a One-Exit Maze&quot;\n   2. &quot;360 Degrees of Power&quot;\n   3. &quot;The Hate that Hate Produced&quot;\n   4. &quot;State of Accommodation: Why Aren't You Angry&quot;\n   5. &quot;Nigga's Gotta&quot;\n   6. &quot;Wild Buck Beer&quot;\n   7. &quot;The Final Solution: Slavery's Back in Effect&quot;\n   8. &quot;Killing Me Softly: Deadly Code of Silence&quot;\n   9. &quot;Umbilical Cord to the Future&quot;\n  10. &quot;The Tom Selloutkin Show&quot;\n  11. &quot;Brainteasers and Doubtbusters&quot;\n  12. &quot;My God is a Powerful God&quot;\n  13. &quot;Survival Handbook vs. Global Extinction&quot;\n\n\nMe?
