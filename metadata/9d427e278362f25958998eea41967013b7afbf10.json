The series takes place in Reading, Berkshire in 1997, where thirteen-year old Simon Doonan and his best friend Kylie dream of escaping their dreary suburban surroundings and moving to cosmopolitan London &quot;to live amongst the beautiful people&quot;.\n\nThe second series of Beautiful People was broadcast in 2009, when Simon returns to Reading to mend his heart after breaking up with his boyfriend Sacha. As in the first series, Simon recounts stories from his childhood in Reading, but speaks directly to the viewer instead of to Sacha. Simon and Kylie's sexuality becomes more overt in the second series as the two lads become more comfortable with themselves. In the series finale, Simon finds himself attracted to a new boy at school, prompting him to come out to his mother after being dissuaded from running away from home.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d427e278362f25958998eea41967013b7afbf10","amp;dn":"Beautiful+People+%28Gay+Interest%29+-+2x2+-+How+I+Got+My+Plumes.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d427e278362f25958998eea41967013b7afbf10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,66,126,39,131,98,242,89,88,153,142,234,65,150,112,19,183,175,191,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
