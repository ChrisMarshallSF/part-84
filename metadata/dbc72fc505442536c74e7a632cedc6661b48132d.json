Upon hiding a folder within the easy to\nuse software interface of Supreme Folder Hider, the folders are removed from\nWindows Explorer entirely. This means that your files and folders cannot be\nclicked on, nor even seen. Windows shortcuts and even recent documents won't be\navailable for anyone to see. Within the folder security software, you can add as\nmany folders as you want for quick hiding. Supreme Folder Hider not only will\nhide folders, but will prevent all file access, even from the command prompt.\n\nInstead of password protecting folders, the file hiding software makes the\nfolders completely invisible.\n\nNotes:\n1. Unlike other software that only hide folders, SFH will prevent people from\nseeing your hidden folders all-together. (It will prompt for a password before\nletting you proceed to it's interface.)\n2. No installation required. Copy to folder and use.\n3. Works with portable media.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Advice on first start\n1. Create Password &gt; Start SFH.\n2. Click 'Options' &gt; 'View Options'.\n3. Enter Password &gt; Confirm Password.\n4. Check 'Require password when program starts'.\n5. Click 'OK'.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbc72fc505442536c74e7a632cedc6661b48132d","amp;dn":"Supreme+Folder+Hider+%28Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbc72fc505442536c74e7a632cedc6661b48132d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,199,47,197,5,68,37,54,199,78,122,99,44,237,198,102,27,72,19,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
