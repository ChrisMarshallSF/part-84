Short of dropping some Agent Orange on the patch, weeds always find a way to come back.\n\nPerhaps the same can be said for the Creeping Weeds, a Philly five-piece that first snaked their way onto the local music scene a half decade ago, but have been largely silent since that debut.\n\nThe Creeping Weeds are back with See Through, their first new album in four years. The batch of songs was officially released Feb. 8, and has been streaming for free on the band's Web site at www.creepingweeds.bandcamp.com.\n\nDespite having just an EP and the 2007 release, We Are All Part of a Dream You're Having, the band's presence has remained strong on the Philly scene, and there is a sense of excitement hanging around the Feb. 12 album-release show for See Through.\n\nChief songwriter Pete Stewart, who also handles lead vocals and guitar for the band, said he and the others were glad to see that they hadn't been forgotten during the down time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.philly.com/community/pa/philadelphia/netimes/Music_Row_Creeping_Weeds_grow_on_you.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.philly.com/community/pa/philadelphia/netimes/Music_Row_Creeping_Weeds_grow_on_you.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly anticipated second album from Philadelphia based band, Creeping Weeds. Although it's a leap forward from 2007's We're Are All Part of A Dream You're Having, the band's signature psychedelic sonics, sly pop hooks and irregular arrangements remain intact. But over time they've been distilled into an eerily dense, cohesive musical statement. On See Through, Creeping Weeds' balance between experimentation, pop and rock has never been more realized or more precarious.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://music.is-amazing.com/2011/02/15/creeping-weeds-see-through-2011&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://music.is-amazing.com/2011/02/15/creeping-weeds-see-through-2011&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
