Developed in the best traditions of classic   \n      police thrillers, in it players match wits against the cunning of a    \n      ruthless serial killer with a macabre signature of leaving playing     \n      cards at the scene of his gruesome crimes. An extra variable in this   \n      desperate pursuit is that the killer is not only aware of your         \n      pursuit, but enjoys it, making it just as dangerous for you as it is   \n      for any other potential victims.                                       \n                                                                             \n      Key Game Features:                                                     \n                                                                             \n      - Crime-solving, action-adventure PC gameplay suitable for teen,       \n        through adult players.                                               \n      - Dark plot full of twists and turns.                                  \n      - Challenging puzzles that require logical thinking.                   \n      - Pieces of evidence that need to be found and analyzed.               \n      - Detailed locations from various places in the United States          \n                                                                             \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                  iNSTALL NOTES                             \n                                                                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n             - Install the game                                              \n             - Enjoy ;)                                                      \n                                                                             \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                   GROUP NOTES                              \n                                                                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n                 Greetings to TRiViUM, euthAnAsia, R.G.
