They taught it would be a one time thing (from there on ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤tributeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ stuck with them), but reaction of the crowd and pure pleasure of playing songs they love were enough of a reason to carry on. After many shows their goal remained the same, to get close as possible to the sound of Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two, and in that they succeeded when they  got a new member in late 2010. Now when they are whole, this is a little promo of their work so far. Three classic tracks packed in custom design made by yet another friend, young Croatian designer.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸\nTracks:\n1  So Doggone Lonesome \n2  Cry Cry Cry\n3  All Over Again.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6feadb33e1aff262b71a818a5add6b7e12a2eaab","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+tribute+Zagreb+%28singl%29+%5B2011%5D++320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6feadb33e1aff262b71a818a5add6b7e12a2eaab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,234,219,51,225,175,242,98,183,26,129,138,90,221,107,126,18,162,234,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
