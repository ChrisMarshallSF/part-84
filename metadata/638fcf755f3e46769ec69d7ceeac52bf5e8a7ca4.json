Elliott recalled first noticing an anomaly in his reality as a child, when he saw the eyes of a primary school teacher momentarily morph into slotted eyes. Later, Elliot said he began receiving mind control messages directed to him through the television, following his discovery of a subliminal soft drink ad campaign at a local store.\n\nAnyone who tries to break free of the system is dealt with, he continued. According to Elliott, he was targeted for group stalking by a government agency working with malicious off-world entities (reptilian shape-shifters). Elliott acknowledged that his story is problematic for those still deluded by the Matrix reality, including many psychiatrists, who conclude such awakened people are mentally ill and in need of medication. &quot;Psychiatry has been established as a gate keeping force to keep people in the Matrix reality, where we are regarded as a human resource by those who run this Matrix and run this world,&quot; he explained. Elliott admitted he may face reprisals for sharing this information on Coast to Coast AM.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring the final two hours of the show, Ian was joined by medical intuitive and psychiatrist Dr. Judith Orloff, who described her work combining &quot;traditional psychiatry with intuition and an appreciation of spiritual realms and alternate realities.&quot; Orloff discussed schizophrenia and Will Elliott's case in particular (see above), noting how the experiences he went through seemed to have been beneficial for him, but the situation can be different for other people, she warned.\n\nThe traditional diagnosis of schizophrenia is characterized by a biochemical imbalance and accompanying alteration in consciousness, Orloff continued, adding that those afflicted with the disorder often experience negative auditory hallucinations and can become violent if not dealt with properly. It is important to empower such people to change their thought patterns, shifting from dark to more positive thoughts, and to offer compassion and not just medication, she explained.\n\nOrloff also talked about emotional vampires -- people who get their energy by feeding off of the emotional reactions of others. &quot;It's like a little tendril attaches to you and sucks your energy right out,&quot; she said. Orloff provided strategies for dealing with emotional vampires, including separating oneself from those who drain you, and visualizing a shield of white light around your entire body that does not allow in any negative energy.\nWebsite(s):\n\n    * will-elliott.org\n    * drjudithorloff.com\n\nBook(s):\n\n    * Strange Places\n    * Emotional Freedom\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638fcf755f3e46769ec69d7ceeac52bf5e8a7ca4","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+2011-01-22+-+False+Reality%2C+Schizophrenia+%26+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638fcf755f3e46769ec69d7ceeac52bf5e8a7ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,143,207,117,95,62,70,118,158,198,157,124,238,172,82,191,94,138,124,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
