It is the band's first original effort since their self-titled album in 1999. It marks the Ratt studio debut for guitarist Carlos Cavazo, formerly of Quiet Riot. It was released by Roadrunner Records, a sub-label of their longtime home Atlantic Records.\n\nIn a March 18, 2010 interview with Metalholic Magazine, guitarist Warren DeMartini said of Infestation: &quot;It really exceeded our expectations. Conceptually we kind of wanted to revisit the period of Out Of The Cellar and Invasion Of Your Privacy. We were sort of loosely trying to shoot for something that could fit between those two records. We were looking for more uptempo ideas and the double leads that Robbin Crosby and I started doing back in 1983.&quot;\n\nTheir 7th studio album, Infestation, was released April 20, 2010. In the US, the album debuted at #30 and sold over 13,000 copies the first week it was released. In Japan, the album charted at #5. The band is currently on an indefinite hiatus.\n\nRatt is an American heavy metal band that had significant commercial success in the 1980s. The band is best known for songs such as &quot;Round and Round,&quot; &quot;Wanted Man,&quot; &quot;Lay It Down,&quot; &quot;You're in Love&quot;, &quot;Slip of the Lip&quot; and &quot;Back For More.&quot; Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s Los Angeles hard rock and glam metal scene.\n(video has a red/white &quot;vh1 classic&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OaEAkAAdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OaEAkAAdf&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:14\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
