Every room is ransacked except for that of their infant son Hunter. The only thing stolen is a necklace that Kristi's sister, Katie (Katie Featherston), had given to her. Following the incident, Dan installs a number of security cameras throughout the house. Kristi and Ali, Dan's daughter from a previous marriage, start to hear noises and see items fall or move on their own in the days ahead. Martine (Vivis Cortez), the family housekeeper and nanny, feels increasingly nervous and attempts to cleanse the house of &quot;evil spirits,&quot; but Dan is uncomfortable with these beliefs and actions, and fires her after catching her burning sage. Kristi talks to Katie about the events in the home, and reveals that the girls were tormented by a demon or unknown spirit when they were children, but Katie cuts off the conversation saying it's better not to discuss such things. Meanwhile, Ali (Molly Ephraim) begins investigating the mysterious happenings in the house. She reads online that on occasion, a human can make a deal with a demon for wealth or power by forfeiting the life of a firstborn son. She realizes that until Hunter, there had not been a male child born in Kristi and Katie's family since the time of their great-great grandmother, and concludes that perhaps a demon is tormenting the family in order to claim the boy for its own\n\nGenre: Horror | Mystery | Thriller\n\nRelease date: 22 October 2010 (UK)\n\nBrian Boland\nMolly Ephraim\nKatie Featherston\nSeth Ginsberg\nSprague Grayden\nMicah Sloat\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:[/b] Paranormal Activity 2\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1267.33 MiB\nDuration: 1h 31mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 944 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\ntrackers\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash:79EE38F8714C3F20F5906F207EC98F0B5A8FD2DD\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/83653616725279370479.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/83653616725279370479.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/25159879197478922670.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/25159879197478922670.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/35355072352955991303.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/35355072352955991303.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/27697040237188884257.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/27697040237188884257.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/88755954510863225968.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/88755954510863225968.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollow HDScene Release Group on Facebook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ee38f8714c3f20f5906f207ec98f0b5a8fd2dd","amp;dn":"Paranormal+Activity+2+Theatrical+720p+BRrip+x264+acc+vice+%28HDSce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ee38f8714c3f20f5906f207ec98f0b5a8fd2dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,238,56,248,113,76,63,32,245,144,111,32,126,201,143,11,90,143,210,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
