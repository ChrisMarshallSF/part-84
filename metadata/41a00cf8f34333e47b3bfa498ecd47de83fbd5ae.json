It is also a match-4 game. The blocks are laid horizontally, which may be jarring for some players. The controls are initially awkward. I am used to accelerating blocks by pressing down. Here it is X; the down button does nothing during game time. The shoulder buttons are used to rotate the individual blocks.\nThere are a few power-ups, which are randomly given rather than randomly appearing. The only way to gain these power-ups is by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchainingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: causing eight blocks to match (as opposed to the random nature of the original Mad Blocker). The power-up is randomly generated, but it also includes a chance of not scoring a power-up at all. The power-up can be used immediately, as it is assigned automatically to Circle, Square or Triangle. And thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a reserve slot, too, if you are full with power-ups on the three buttons\nThe hit web game puzzle franchise comes home in Mad Blocker Alpha. Mad Blocker is a traditional puzzler based around the lining up of 4 or more blocks of the same color. The game is fairly straight forward but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the hand drawn visuals and ease of play that are the games main attraction. See how many Fluzzles you can save!!\nMad Blocker Alpha promises to be &quot;The best Mad Blocker experience yet&quot; with way more backgrounds, block types, new power ups, new game modes, an expansive story mode, with comic book style story sequences and a riveting soundtrack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a00cf8f34333e47b3bfa498ecd47de83fbd5ae","amp;dn":"Mad+Blocker+Alpha+Revenge+Of+The+Fluzzles+%5BEnglish%5D%5BPSP%5D%5BMINIS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a00cf8f34333e47b3bfa498ecd47de83fbd5ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,160,12,248,243,67,51,228,123,59,250,73,142,205,71,222,131,251,213,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
