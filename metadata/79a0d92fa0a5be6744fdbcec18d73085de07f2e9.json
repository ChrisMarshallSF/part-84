This package was built using ArchLinux and also tested on Ubuntu 10.04, it should work properly on any Linux distribution with wine properly installed.\n\nTo install the game run da2_installer.sh. This will extract the archive to ~/.wine/wineprefixes/DragonAge2. \n\nTo launch the game execute the script located in ~/bin, either by double clicking on it, or from a terminal enter: &quot;~/bin/DragonAge2&quot; (case sensative). I reccomend adding $HOME/bin to your PATH, especially if you want to use more then one corkscrew (hint: google it). A desktop launcher is not included with this release, but you can easily make one yourself using the included icon.\n\nTo uninstall delete the DragonAge2 folder in ~/.wine/wineprefixes.\n\nI encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other applications and games. This package along with the installer can be freely redistributed and/or modified only by qualified software pirates. If you are happy to see a game or program you like running on linux be sure to let the developers know. \n\nFor other packages just search &quot;CorkScrew&quot; on your favorite torrenting site. \n\nAny requests/feedback/questions/issues/comments/virgin offerings, are welcome. Contact me on Demonoid:or leave a comment on thepiratebay, i check both regularly.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a0d92fa0a5be6744fdbcec18d73085de07f2e9","amp;dn":"CorkScrew+Dragon+Age+2+for+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a0d92fa0a5be6744fdbcec18d73085de07f2e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,160,217,47,160,165,190,103,68,253,188,236,24,215,48,133,222,7,242,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
