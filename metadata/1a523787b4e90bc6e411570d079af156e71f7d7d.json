The answer, of course, was &quot;DJ'ING.&quot;\n\nNow DJ King Pigeon travels the world hunting down and sharing rare musical artifacts. Whether these treasures are Estonian girl groups, Russian rap stars, Belgian...whatever D.J.F.R.A.N.K. is...or Polish trance artists, he collects them with the skill and determination of Indiana Jones--because DJ King Pigeon knows that these treasures need to be in a museum.\n\nSo welcome to the Museum of &quot;Eurotrash or Eurotreasure?&quot; DJ King Pigeon is its curator*, and you are its visitors. Please enjoy yourselves, and don't fart--that's disgusting.\n\n* You thought I was going to say &quot;Sticky the Stick,&quot; didn't you?\n\n\nWood Allen - Airport 89\nWee Papa Rappers - Heat It Up (Acid House Mix)\n2 in a Room - Wiggle It\nTensnake - Coma Cat\nYoung MC - Bust a Move\nB Beat Girls - For the Same Man\nJitka Charatova - Real Life\nAnticappella - Everyday (Extended Mix)\nGeorge Kranz - Din Daa Daa (Trommeltanz)\nMorgan &amp; Bland - Bongo Gongo (Original Extended Version)\nJochen Simms - Set Me Up (Original)\nThe Dee - Tick Tock to 2d Beat (Extended)\nThe Future Sound of London - Papua New Guinea (12&quot; Original)\nBarbarella - Barbarella (My Name Is Barbarella/The Spaceship)\nLauren Flax - You've Changed (feat.
