It's very amusing, albiet for all the wrong reasons. This version has Japanese subtitles that can't be removed unfortunately but the spoken language is English, so it can still be 'enjoyed' by all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1708362d7bfe054fd05110902c5c2a90b75637f","amp;dn":"Robowar+-+1989+%28Reb+Brown%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1708362d7bfe054fd05110902c5c2a90b75637f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,112,131,98,215,191,224,84,253,5,17,9,2,197,194,169,11,117,99,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
