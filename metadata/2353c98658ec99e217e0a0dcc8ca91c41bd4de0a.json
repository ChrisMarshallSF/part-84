Like many\ngood 80's films, &quot;Real Genius&quot; is backdropped by a memorable soundtrack.\n\nUnfortunately, like many other 80s films, it suffered from a horriblly\ngrainy DVD transfer. (The &quot;glowing Kilmer&quot; DVD cover was also hideous.)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: x264, CQ16, LEM, Lanczosmtplus, MVDegrain3\nFrame Size ............: 720x368, anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen DAR of 864x368\nVideo FPS .............: 23.976fps\nAudio .................: 0.35 Nero AAC\nSubtitles .............: 24 languages -- see files.\n\nSubjective appearance compared to original grainy DVD source VOB:\nnoticeably superior. The TriStar Pegasus logo is as crappy as ever,\nbut the rest cleaned up very well.\n\n\n\nOne of the all time best 80's college movies, 3 November 2001\n10/10  Author: thirdi from United States\n\nVal Kilmer is hilarious as a college genius on par with Einstein, but is more interested in partying and chasing girls. A new arrival to the campus, Mitch, is a brilliant 15 year-old whom Val takes under his wing and tries to get to loosen up and have a good time.\n\nThere are probably some important themes and ideas to analyze within this movie, but for me it's just an old-school personal favorite that I've seen about 100 times. Great 80's music soundtrack and funny performances. William Atherton is perfect as the self-important, snobby professor, and another highlight is Robert Prescott, who plays his butt-kissing, nerdy assistant &quot;Kent&quot;.\n\nA movie that asks the question, isn't life experience just as important for education, as classrooms and books? A very funny, fine film that is up there with &quot;Animal House&quot; in my opinion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2353c98658ec99e217e0a0dcc8ca91c41bd4de0a","amp;dn":"Real+Genius+1985+fim+OST+Honeyko+x264+aac+DVDrip+proper+24fps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2353c98658ec99e217e0a0dcc8ca91c41bd4de0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,83,201,134,88,236,153,226,23,224,160,220,200,202,145,196,27,212,222,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
