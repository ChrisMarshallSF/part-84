The film begins with Cohen delivering a comic monologue about his visit to a friend in a Montreal mental hospital.

His poetry readings are principally from &quot;A Spice-box of Earth&quot; and &quot;Flowers for Hitler&quot;. A press conference with Cohen and his friend Irving Layton forms a part of the film. \n\nFilmed and recorded at various locations in 1964, released in 1965 by the National Film Board of Canada.
