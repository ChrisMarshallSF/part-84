Mill argued that seeking the greatest good for\n      the greatest number is compatible with protecting individual\n      rights, and that utilitarianism can make room for a distinction\n      between higher and lower pleasures. Sandel tests Mill's theory\n      that that the higher pleasure is that which is preferred by a\n      well-informed majority by playing video clips from three very\n      different forms of entertainment - Shakespeare's Hamlet, the\n      reality show Fear Factor and The Simpsons. Students debate their\n      own preferences and whether Mill's defense of utilitarianism is\n      successful.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
