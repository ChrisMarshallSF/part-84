Although pianist Perkins takes vocals on most of the songs and bassist Jones sings on two of the numbers, nearly each selection has plenty of solo space for Earl and Perkins. Sticking exclusively to the blues at a variety of tempos, the fine program (which has superior instrumental playing that overshadows the personable vocals) should be of strong interest to both blues and jazz collectors.\nby Scott Yanow ''allmusic''\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5de04adac1874dbf15ee2776cb3a25e449ab1ad","amp;dn":"Earl-Perkins-Jones-Smith-++Eye+-+1996%28Blues%29%5BFLAC%5D%5Bgeo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5de04adac1874dbf15ee2776cb3a25e449ab1ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,222,4,173,172,24,116,219,241,94,226,119,108,179,162,94,68,154,177,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
