Every day, too many teen girls fear for their lives because of obsessive, controlling and abusive boyfriends, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s another reason why Dr. Phil is so passionate about his campaign to End the Silence on Domestic Violence. Seventeen-year-old Samantha sent an urgent plea for help to Dr. Phil. She says that after she broke up with him, her ex-boyfriend, Aaron, called her nonstop and sent her threatening text messages. When Samantha changed her number, he began calling her mother repeatedly. Samantha says he also showed up at her house and pounded on the door, while she cowered in a locked closet. She says sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s afraid Aaron could even kill her. Dr. Phil sits down with the two teens to help Samantha get her message to Aaron loud and clear. And, Tiffany, 20, has a cautionary tale of survival every teen needs to hear. Plus, Dr. Phil announces his partnership with important organizations to address the issue of teen dating violence in schools across the country. This ValentineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Day, sit down and watch this show with your teen daughter to show her that love is not abuse. It could save her life! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ec15048aebc48974e0bb68aa47cc858814c06c","amp;dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2011.02.14.Teens.Obsessed.With.Love.HDTV.Xvid-NBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ec15048aebc48974e0bb68aa47cc858814c06c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,236,21,4,138,235,196,137,116,224,187,104,170,71,204,133,136,20,192,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
