Not ENTIRELY sure how a one-hit wonder can have a greatest hits CD, but since I really like this CD, and tend to blare it while driving down the road, I won't question too closely. :')\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Puttin' On The Ritz\n2. Singin' In The Rain\n3. Encore (Sweet Gypsy Rose)\n4. In The Mood\n5. Chattanooga Choo Choo\n6. There May Be Trouble Ahead\n7. La Vie En Rose\n8. Frenesi\n9. Perfidia\n10. Mas Que Nada \n\nHope you enjoy!
