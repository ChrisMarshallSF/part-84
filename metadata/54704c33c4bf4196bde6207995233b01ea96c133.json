How then do you make head or tail of a movie so intentionally disjointed, confusing and artsy such as &quot;C'est Gradiva Qui Vous Appelle&quot;?\n\nWell Gradiva may be calling all right ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but it's very difficult to answer, so to speak. This director, an 86-year-old man, apparently makes films that make sense to nobody but himself. The true artiste, if you like. &quot;Gradiva&quot; introduces an archaeologist (James Wilby) to us, and sets him off to chase the mysterious titular girl (also a double identity for Leila, played by the gorgeous veteran French-American actress Arielle Dombastle) while bedding his slave girl Belkis (Dany Verissimo) at every interval. This pretty much forms the plot for a person who is watching it on operational terms.\n\n&quot;Gradiva&quot; would have been infinitely more difficult to watch if not for Dany Verissimo, the sultry porno-inclined actress that you might recognise from &quot;Banlieue 13&quot;. The three leads all delivered good performances, one assumes, but the story is told in such a way that it projects little regard for audience understanding. Which bit is a dream allegory? Which bit is the &quot;true&quot; timeline? Only director Alain Robbe-Grillet and film students would know, I suppose. To others, &quot;Gradiva&quot; is a 110-minute long indulgence with plenty of artsy frontal nudity and sadomasochistic violence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54704c33c4bf4196bde6207995233b01ea96c133","amp;dn":"Gradiva+aka+It%5C%27s+Gradiva+Who+Is+Calling+You+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54704c33c4bf4196bde6207995233b01ea96c133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,112,76,51,196,191,65,150,189,230,32,121,149,35,59,1,234,150,193,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
