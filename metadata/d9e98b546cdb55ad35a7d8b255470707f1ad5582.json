It is a mix of magazines I've obtained online and the rest scanned from my personal collection. The quality varies (my scans are better than the web originated ones) but they are very legible on the iPad and Kindle DX. If you are looking to learn Japanese, you won't find a better way not to sound like a newb than reading this magazine, which translates and meticulously explains Japanese colloquialisms, Kansai/Kanto dialect differences, politeness forms, giongo/gitaigo and a ton of other stuff. I've never lived in Japan and studied for 3 years at a university level and thanks mostly to this mag, I often get asked &quot;how long have you lived in Japan?&quot; when I visit. It really is that good at helping you sound like a native speaker.\n\nEnjoy and keep seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9e98b546cdb55ad35a7d8b255470707f1ad5582","amp;dn":"Mangajin+1-70+PDF+format","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9e98b546cdb55ad35a7d8b255470707f1ad5582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,233,139,84,108,219,85,173,53,167,216,178,85,71,7,7,241,173,85,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
