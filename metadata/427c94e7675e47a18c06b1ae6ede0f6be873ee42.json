The print doesn't seem to be in very good shape, but this 28-minute film is very watchable even with all the obvious damage to the negative. This copy is hardcoded with very legible English subtitles. Thanks again to Glynford for providing it.\n\nAnd once again, here is a review from Slant Magazine by Keith Uhlich.
