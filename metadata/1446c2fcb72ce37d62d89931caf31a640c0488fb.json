I have spent over 100 hours and remastered\na full DTS 5.1 Surround Version of &quot;Thriller&quot;. This process involves using the\noriginal vinyl record and separating frequencies and isolating them to form\na surround experience!  All you need is Roxio, Nero or anything that will burn\nan ISO file to dvd.  Burn dvd put in your home theatre dvd player and hear\nmore of MJ than ever before.  It will feel like he is in the room with you!\nPlease seed and share with the world and leave comments on your listening \nexperience.  It is a labour of love doing projects like this and I love to \nhave encouraging feedback.  CHEERS \n\nRickster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1446c2fcb72ce37d62d89931caf31a640c0488fb","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+Thriller.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1446c2fcb72ce37d62d89931caf31a640c0488fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,70,194,252,183,44,227,125,98,216,153,49,202,243,26,100,12,4,136,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
