Naruse shows his considerable skill at portraying household dynamics, filming KyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ in relaxed and/or reclining positions (indicative of her character's exhaustively maintained independence) that are then intruded upon by her ill-tempered older brother (Masayuki Mori), whose initially comic, brute-force presence grows increasingly menacing and treacherous as the film progresses. Among the stand-out sequences: an illuminative interlude by a river where several hundred townspeople let loose a flurry of small model boats carrying candles and a bittersweet scene where KyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ and her bookish younger sister return home, after some world-wearying big city experiences, along literally divergent country roads that eventually intersect.\n~Keith Uhlich @ Slant\n\nA snippet from the Film Society of Lincoln Center:\nIn Older Brother, Younger Sister, the ground floor of the family home is a vast space offering neither solace nor protection to the family members, who occupy it like travelers at a rest stop; an emblematic shot shows the angry brother in the foreground, with the pregnant and unmarried sister and the resigned, fatalistic mother isolated in separate areas of the background.\n\n=================================\n\nFile Name .........................................: Ani imouto.avi \nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 938,612,090 bytes \nRuntime ............................................: 1:26:13 \n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4 \nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333) \nFPS .................................................: 23.976 \nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1336 kb/s \nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.181 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], [] \n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz \nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 103 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR \nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n=================================\n\nOther related torrents at: thepiratebay.se/user/rpessoa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f647df226f79083245734adc88793710417e44","amp;dn":"Ani+imouto+AKA+Older+Brother%2C+Younger+Sister+%28Mikio+Naruse%2C+1953","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f647df226f79083245734adc88793710417e44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,246,71,223,34,111,121,8,50,69,115,74,220,136,121,55,16,65,126,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
