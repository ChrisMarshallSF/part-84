Now\n              a team of archeologists have made a major discovery in\n              the Syrian desert: artifacts from a burial chamber\n              deep within an ancient palace that paint a\n              never-before-seen picture of a powerful metropolis\n              known as Qatna. What became of its vast riches? And\n              what brought about the final fate of this ancient\n              superpower?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        GREETS:\n                    - FQM - CTU - REVEiLLE - XOXO -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4997bc39c41f0742d01a754ec3774b34031fe03","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Egypts.Lost.Rival.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4997bc39c41f0742d01a754ec3774b34031fe03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,153,123,195,156,65,240,116,45,1,167,84,236,55,116,179,64,49,254,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
