First off, this is something that ALL users of TPB need to have installed.  This auto uploads to your computer the most recent block list of known malicious trackers that either want to give you viruses or want to prosecute you for alleged infringement charges.  This also spoofs your IP address to others that are downloading the same torrent as you, so if there is anyone investigating the peers downloading a given torrent, they will not be able to locate you via the long list of peers that are connected.\n\nPrior to having this installed, I used to frequently get copyright infringement emails from my ISP, after, not so much as one of those emails.\n\nEnjoy, seed, and plug this torrent on other torrents via a link so we all can sail the waters free of molestation.
