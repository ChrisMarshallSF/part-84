Add Stevie Wonder's &quot;My Cherie Amour,&quot; Martha &amp; the Vandellas' &quot;Dancing in the Street,&quot; and the Miracles' &quot;Tracks of My Tears,&quot; and you're on to a winner. Motown Charbusters, Vol. 3 is arguably the most enjoyable of the 12 collections. Not only does the track selection flow and appear to be well chosen, but there at least ten big hits here that have become legendary. The album focuses mainly on the mid-'60s period, bringing together gems such as the Temptations' &quot;Get Ready,&quot;moreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Stevie Wonder's &quot;For Once in My Life,&quot; and the Isley Brothers' &quot;This Old Heart of Mine.&quot; Released at the time when Motown was really building momentum in the U.K. and U.S.A., this is an essential purchase for all the label's fans.\n\n1.
