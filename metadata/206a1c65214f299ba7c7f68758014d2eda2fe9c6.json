After serving 24 years in the Royal Navy, mostly in diesel submaries, he emigrated to Salmo, British Columbia, to live somewhere different form a large port. Salmo definitely qualifies. &quot;An Ex-Sailor's Life&quot; may explain his decision to settle in the interior of British Columbia. &quot;Showers&quot; definitely seems autobiographical.\n\n\nThis was fifth album, released in 1999 by Borealis Recording Company Ltd. of Toronto. I bought this album at a library's ongoing book sale, one of thirty-odd CDs for $1 each; this album alone was worth the total price of the lot.\n\n\nTom's website is www.tomlewis.net, and seems to be more up-to-date than the home page indicates; the tour dates are current.\n\n\nIf you like this album, please buy more of Tom's stuff. His last album was released in 2003; maybe a few extra sales will convince him to release a new one.\n\n\nRipped by Free Music CD Converter\n\n\nTrack listing:\n01. All the Good Times.flac\n02.
