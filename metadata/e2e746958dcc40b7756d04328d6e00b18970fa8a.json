This cross-generation drama is about second chances.\nThe protagonist of the film (Akshay Kumar) runs a corner shop in Southall but his desire is to break into sports/cricket. His father is a strict traditionalist and his mission is to ensure his family do not lose their Indian culture and identity. Akshay, however wants to play cricket ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not for India but for England ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and he gets the chance to do this. Also, according to the makers of the film, cricket is just the catalyst, the real deal is father-son drama.\nThe film is also about British Asian identity and the cross-generational conflict between a father and son. The primary message of the film is about family ties and duty, a yearning to follow oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dreams, and trying to make sense of the dichotomies that life presents when oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family has migrated to another land.\n\nNOTES : RippeR brings to you another high quality release in small size.
