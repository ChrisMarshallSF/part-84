The film opens at a party at the gorgeous multi-million pound country home of Leo, his wife, Jane (Jessica Turner) and their three children. To LeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acquaintances, he appears to have the perfect life: LeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a happily married, successful financial analyst. Envied by his society friends, everyone wonders just how Leo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdoes it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He seems to have the Midas touch.\n\nThe story gradually strips away the layers of lies surrounding LeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life. A practiced con man, Leo cashes in on the greed of his friends and relatives, but since Leo is also addicted to gambling, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just a matter of time before his life crumbles into ruin.\n\nThe film is rather well executed. Hugh Laurie is perfectly cast as Leo, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surrounded here by an equally excellent castÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“including Bob Monkhouse as his boss, Giles. Leo is funny, unassuming and seems to be non-threatening (in contrast to some of his sleazier friends, Duncan, for example). Leo appears to be just eccentric enough to be a financial wizard, so when he promises his friends impossibly high returns on investments, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all too happy to believe it. Leo is particularly good at deceiving women, and we see the three main women he manipulatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“his wife Jane, his long-suffering and far-too-devoted secretary Marion (Pippa Guard) and Diane (Sioban McCarthy)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“a woman who places LeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s insane bets.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the characters here that make the film so rich. Leo moves in a society thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largely superficialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“a society in which markers of affluence are more important than how that affluence was achieved. And since a frank discussion of money making is considered bad form, Leo can acquire his friendsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ money with few questions asked.\n\nOn the surface, Leo is a very likeable fellow, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so likeable that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see how he gets away with so much. On the other hand, some of his greed-bag friends are pushy and unpleasant. We tend to think of con men as greedy, mean spirited people, but Leo is portrayed as someone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largely oblivious to the damage he causes, and if he does stop to think about what he does, he marks his actions up to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“wanting people to like him.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ The acting is excellent, and the conclusion isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t easy to predictÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“in spite of all the very obvious paths this story takes. At one point, the film hints that Leo has fabricated other parts of his life; in an early scene, he slips when recalling his university days, but the film, rather frustratingly, just hints at this and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t explore this aspect of LeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life any further. If you like British television drama, then thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an excellent chance that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll enjoy this entertaining drama.
