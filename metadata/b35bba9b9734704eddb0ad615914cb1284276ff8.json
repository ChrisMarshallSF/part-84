Hawkwind LIVE. The first is &quot;Night of The Hawks&quot; live 1984 at The Gaumont Theatre, Ipswich, UK. The second is &quot;Classic Rock Legends&quot; live in 1990. Not sure about the venue, but it's a nice trippy few hours of The Hawks! NTSC vts/vob files. Menus preserved, untouched. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35bba9b9734704eddb0ad615914cb1284276ff8","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+Night+Of+the+Hawks+and+Classic+Rock+Legends+LIVE+dvds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35bba9b9734704eddb0ad615914cb1284276ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,91,186,155,151,52,112,78,221,176,173,97,89,20,203,18,132,39,111,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
