So maybe it's better this way ...\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThis version of N360 is NOT the previous Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Beta version !!! \n*******************************************************************************\nTo check which version this is: \n1. Right-click on the installer of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125, and select [Properties].\n2. At the Properties window click on the [Version] tab.\n3. In the list of the Item name window click on [Original file name].\n4. Check the name at the window next to the Item name window.\n\nSymantec labelled the Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 installers as follow:\n1. Original filename of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Standard Beta = N360-Beta.exe\n2. Original filename of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Standard = N360.exe\n3. Original filename of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Premier = N360-Premier.exe\n\nSymantec officially did NOT label this version as Beta, based on the facts that:\nthe name Beta is NOT used in both the name of this installer and at the installer \nits file properties, and also the name Beta is not used in the Symantec download \nlinks.\n\n\nThe Product Date info at file properties of both the installer of the \nBeta and this version of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 shows as date: 12/02/2010\n\nThe digitally signed timestamps of both the installer of the Beta and this\nversion of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 show as date: saturday 4 december 2010.\n \nHowever, the N360 v5.0.0.125 Beta was released early december 2010, \nwhile this version of N360 v5.0.0.125 was released early february 2011.\n\nAlso the names of the Symantec download links from this release contain \nthe letter combination OEM or ESD (e.g. 60-30 days trial version) to \nindicate that it's not the Beta version. \n\nThis release also comes from an official Symantec download link, \nbut for some reason apparently this v5.0.0.125 still is not \navailable as download at Symantec itself.\n\n\n* Conclusion, according the names of this installer and at the installer \nits file properties, and also because of the names of the download links: \nthis version is officially NOT labelled by Symantec as Beta. \n\nThe name of this torrent will be corrected by the time Symantec \nofficially labels this v5.0.0.125 also a Beta (Public Beta). \n\nIn the meanwhile the name Final is used because so far this version \nis released as Final everywhere else except at Symantec itself.\n \nFor now this version is also labelled as Final to indicate that \nthis version is NOT the previous v5.0.0.125 beta.\n\nSoon the whole discussion on the web about this version will be over. \nFor now it's up to you to argue about this version and to decide whether \nthis is the Final or Beta version, or whatever version you think it is. \n\n\nFor complaints or a refund about the current and known &quot;Beta or Final&quot; issue:\n*****************************************************************************\nPlease just STFU, and go bother the Symantec Customer Service. :P\n\n\nMore info:\n********** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://community.norton.com/t5/Norton-360-v5-Public-Beta/Norton-360-5-0-0-125-Final-over-at-majorgeeks-com/td-p/390754&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://community.norton.com/t5/Norton-360-v5-Public-Beta/Norton-360-5-0-0-125-Final-over-at-majorgeeks-com/td-p/390754&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPrivate note:\n************* \nSpecial greetz to Rupert77, also known as &quot;Rebel Without a Clue&quot; ... lulz\nBETA ...

AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1. Norton Internet Security \n2. Avira AntiVir Premium \n3. avast! Pro Antivirus\n4. Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.\nMalware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at February 05, 2011 - 03.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c72bb6cc72ad13e3e33552405ab6f93c57a4e8ca","amp;dn":"Norton+360+v5.0.0.125+Premier+%28Final%29+%2B+Patch+%2890+Days%29+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c72bb6cc72ad13e3e33552405ab6f93c57a4e8ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,43,182,204,114,173,19,227,227,53,82,64,90,182,249,60,87,164,232,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
