Kenosis\n\nPress Release: Mechanization Announces ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKenosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2011 Mechanization | www.mechanization.us\n\nReturning from three years in the dungeon, Mechanization releases their second full-length album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKenosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which blasts to the core of all that is Mechanization. Whereas their first album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHolonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was an experimental voyage, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKenosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a sledgehammer to the collective spine of mankind. Quite simply put: ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a heavy metal champagne jam, and the world is invited to partake in the destruction. Every song was intentionally designed to split heads and crush souls. With tracks such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEntering the Shed of Fire, and Taming the Serpent,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMedieval War Song,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRipping the Tusk from the Head of the Mammoth,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ you can easily see that Mechanization holds nothing back and delivers the uranium (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the heaviest metal in the world for you Bieber and Gaga fans). TerrorenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vicious growls, HMTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shredding riffs, and technologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relentless groove deliver one sonic punch to the sternum after another. The forces beckoned to create this masterpiece are so brutal that legions of robotic dragons couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop the impending impact that all shall witness. Alas, words about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKenosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are the same as words about love, sex, and war--meaningless compared to the actual experience. So grab yourself an axe and a taco because the world as you know it will never be the same.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed62d910ce0f816eb994375717822193d4257735","amp;dn":"Mechanization+-+Kenosis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed62d910ce0f816eb994375717822193d4257735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,98,217,16,206,15,129,110,185,148,55,87,23,130,33,147,212,37,119,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
