The Either/Orchestra, a 10-piece jazz orchestra based in Boston, are among the first non-Ethiopian artists to become serious interpreters of Ethiopian music. Recorded live at a historic concert ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the first performance by a U.S. big band in Ethiopia since Duke Ellington in 1973. The results blend state-of-the-art playing and an exotic, captivating Ethiopian program into a kind of Buena Vista Social Club Addis-style, featuring several Ethiopian elder statesmen performing with a big band for the first time since the 1960s, and two younger singers doing so for the first time. Inspired by the great Ethiopian pop and jazz of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s, the E/O has brought the full array of modern jazz and Afro-Cuban innovations to an Ethiopian repertoire.\n\n\nRipped with EAC, encoded with Lame VBR average bit rate 230 kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab8089f873244193efdaa6f83483ad89d3f2c00","amp;dn":"Either+Orchestra+-+Live+in+Addis+%5B2004%5D+%28VBR+mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab8089f873244193efdaa6f83483ad89d3f2c00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,184,8,159,135,50,68,25,62,253,170,111,131,72,58,216,157,63,44,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
