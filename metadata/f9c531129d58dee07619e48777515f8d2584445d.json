Lacking better information, I can only assume these three house cats composed and recorded the two tracks contained in this torrent.\n\nAlthough the webcomic portrays some Tenmen songs as having lyrics, &quot;Sidewalk Song&quot; and &quot;80&quot; are instrumentals.\n\nYour bemusement is appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9c531129d58dee07619e48777515f8d2584445d","amp;dn":"Achewood+The+Tenmen+two+songs+from+Achewood+Radio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9c531129d58dee07619e48777515f8d2584445d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,197,49,18,157,88,222,224,118,25,228,135,119,81,95,141,37,132,68,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
