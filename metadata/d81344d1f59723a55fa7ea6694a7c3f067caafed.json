The Battle Brawlers have returned to Earth, and Marucho has turned control of Bakugan Interspace over to the computer so he can compete freely. Dan, Shun, and Marucho have formed a team together, and Dan is ranked #1 in the World. However new mysterious Brawlers are popping up to challenge Dan and Drago, and Dan and Drago keep having dreams of a mysterious Bakugan they don't know that wants to steal Drago's powers to take over the universe. Believing them to be only nightmares, Dan accepts a battle from the #2 ranked team- Team Anubis, but the powers Drago ends up unleashing could end up harming everyone in Interspace if they aren't careful.
