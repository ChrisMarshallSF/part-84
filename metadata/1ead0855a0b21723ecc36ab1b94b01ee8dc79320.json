During the era that Satisfaction Guaranteed covers, Smith scored more Top 10 hits than either Hank Williams or Lefty Frizzell, and many of his best songs -- &quot;Loose Talk,&quot; &quot;Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way,&quot; &quot;Hey Joe!,&quot; &quot;Are You Teasing Me,&quot; and &quot;(When You Feel Like You're In Love) Don't Just Stand There,&quot; among them -- are stone-cold honky tonk classics. For serious Smith and honky tonk fans, the set is essential, but the sheer length of the box -- not to mention its strict chronological sequence -- is tedious for anyone that isn't willing to dedicate the time to plow through the abundance of material here. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ead0855a0b21723ecc36ab1b94b01ee8dc79320","amp;dn":"Carl+Smith+-+Satisfaction+Guaranteed+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ead0855a0b21723ecc36ab1b94b01ee8dc79320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,173,8,85,160,178,23,35,236,195,106,177,185,75,1,238,141,199,147,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
