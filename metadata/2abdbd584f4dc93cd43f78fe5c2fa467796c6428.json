Sparking the debate is attorney and legal analyst Dan Abrams, author of Man Down: Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt That Women Are Better Cops, Drivers, Gamblers, Spies, World Leaders, Beer Tasters, Hedge Fund Managers, and Just About Everything Else. Learn the compelling evidence behind his book that shows why women are superior to men in a variety of ways!\n\nThe Battle of the Sexes\nWho has a better memory, men or women? Who gets ready faster? Comedians Kate Rigg, Kathleen Madigan and Kirk Fox put DanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s evidence to the test. And, who tolerates pain better? Speak up and vote!\n\nWho Does It Better?\nMusic producer David Foster may know women better than anyone, with six sisters and five daughters. He joins the debate, along with his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, Yolanda Hadid. Who is better at handling a break-up? Who makes a better driver, police officer and doctor? Plus, OB/GYN and co-host of the Emmy award-winning show, The Doctors, Dr. Lisa Masterson gives her insight.
