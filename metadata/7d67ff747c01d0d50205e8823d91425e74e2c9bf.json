Consequently, they have come out and formed La Petite Manouche - a guitar duo with influences of gypsy and modern jazz, creating a unique fusion of music. Influences are widespread, ranging from Django to classical and baroque music, free jazz to fusion, celtic and world music, even popular and dance music. Notable influences include BirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©li LagrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne, Sylvain Luc, The Rosenberg Trio, Ulf Wakenius, Pat Metheny, and Jonathan Kreisberg.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d67ff747c01d0d50205e8823d91425e74e2c9bf","amp;dn":"Legacy+-+La+Petite+Manouche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d67ff747c01d0d50205e8823d91425e74e2c9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,103,255,116,124,1,208,213,2,5,232,130,61,145,66,94,116,226,201,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
