Even though she's settled into a home in the Texas Hill Country, she still puts upwards of 60,000 miles a year on her customized Freightliner van. And her latest trip, to satisfy that travelin' itch, is OuterSpace.\n\nThat's the name of Gibson's new recording, which stretches her musical boundaries with its roots-rock sound and is easily the edgiest work she's ever done. The new album also includes a live version of the Gibson-penned &quot;Wide Open Spaces,&quot; which Dixie Chicks propelled into one of the all-time best-selling country songs. The album Wide Open Spaces has sold 16 million copies and Gibson sports a tiny chicken foot tattoo to mark its success. \n\nThe song is a helpful introduction that immediately sticks with people who know the song but don't necessarily know Gibson.\n\n\n&quot;The flip side of that coin is that if my songs are like my children, 'Wide Open Spaces' is my professional child who might take care of me in my old age,&quot; Gibson says, smiling. &quot;Some of the other songs I have written are like the adolescent adult children who refuse to leave home.&quot;\n\nBalancing writing and performing is easy for Gibson, whose live shows draw a steady stream of fans including some who travel miles to see show after show.\n\n\n&quot;The writing is sincere, and that makes it easy to perform,&quot; she says. &quot;Likewise, the fact that I go out and perform these songs and have to look people in the eye keeps the writing sincere. It's one of the more beautiful vicious circles that I know.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/19/susan-gibson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/19/susan-gibson/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:210a08112c7090b50b951f22a4fdc0f2b553d5f0","amp;dn":"Susan+Gibson...Outerspace%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"210a08112c7090b50b951f22a4fdc0f2b553d5f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,10,8,17,44,112,144,181,11,149,31,34,164,253,192,242,181,83,213,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
