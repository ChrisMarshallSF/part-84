Plus extra DVD-ROM files on the disc containing many additional ads and rarities, some in full NTSC DVD quality.\n\nRichard Williams is the three-time Academy Award winning animation director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, A Christmas Carol, and the unfinished cult classic The Thief and the Cobbler [available in its Recobbled Cut at Youtube]. He is the author of The Animator's Survival Kit [and the 16-DVD instruction course of the same title],  which has won acclaim as possibly the best available resource for aspiring animators. Richard Williams is considered one of the great animators and animation teachers of all time.\n\nDuring the 70s and 80s in particular, Williams' animation studio was known for its incredible animated advertisements, which pushed the boundaries of what animation could do by adopting a huge variety of styles including realistic fine art. It was a golden time for commercial animation in London and Williams' studio was just one of many producing incredible work ... but Richard Williams Animation Studio was always at the forefront.\n\nCompiled by Thief and the Cobbler Recobbled Cut editor Garrett Gilchrist, who runs the Richard Williams archive on [You]tube at thethiefarchive.\n\nThis is the ultimate collection to date of animated adverts by Richard Williams Animation Studio, with animators including Russell Hall, Eric Goldberg, Tony White, and many more.
