Well, EMI (Purple's Label for the world outside the US) was in FACT responsible for THAT release and Rhino only picked it up after it was done... \n\nAnd now, once again, EMI has prepared a remastered, expanded edition of &quot;Stormbringer&quot; (working with Glenn again) for release outside the US...yeah, I know, it stinks having to pay for import CD's, but c'mon, this is Purple we're talking about! I'm sure you'd prefer the WHOLE package, wouldn't you? I know I do! \n\nI have nothing against THIS release from Friday Music (actually, I think it is a worthy effort to salvage a long lost, truly awesome album), I haven't even heard it yet, so I can't really critizise it, but I felt compelled to give ya 'all a heads-up about this... \n\nStormbringer? It's a jewel, one of my fav Purple albums, even if it is a true departure from their trademark fast paced, guitar driven sound...I like it even more than the MK II albums...yeah...that's how much I like it...if you want a little more in depth comment about the songs, check out my review of the 2 CD pack of &quot;Burn/Stormbringer&quot;... \n\nThe only reason why I give this CD 4 stars and not 5 is because I'd rather wait for the expanded EMI release...But hey, it's your dough, after all, and God knows I'd be the last person in the world to be telling other people what to do... \n\nPeace and Rock On...\n\nby Erick Bertin\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Stormbringer.wma                                            \n02 - Love Don't Mean A Thing.wma                                 \n03 - Holy Man.wma                                                \n04 - Hold On.wma                                                 \n05 - Lady Double Dealer.wma                                      \n06 - You Can't Do It Right (With The One You Love).wma           \n07 - High Ball Shooter.wma                                       \n08 - The Gypsy.wma                                               \n09 - Soldier Of Fortune.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t\n\nFOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK PAGES: MARCELODRGZTPB\n\nATTENTION: I will read comments on all the material shared only on my Facebook page (MARCELODRGZTPB).
