Drew, to be sure,) the tapes sat gathering dust in the closets of Studio X (now Bad Animals) in Seattle. Now released in their retro glory as we near twenty years since the breakthrough dawn of grunge, the tracks are best viewed through the lens of your mindset in 1996. So travel back with meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦to a time when David Duchovny was the hottest name working in Hollywood. Michael Jordan was just about to embark on his second three-peat. Eve 6 wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t score a single with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInside OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for another two years, leading to that event sometimes being referred to in music circles as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Beginning of the End.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe song selection for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive on I5,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ particularly when viewed as a reflection of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown on the UpsideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tour, is both good and bad. While there are many album cuts that radio-only Soundgarden fans wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know (a messy, colored-outside-the-lines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSearching With My Good Eye ClosedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for one,) there is also a distinct lack of material from SoundgardenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early years. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œScreaming Life,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heady debut EP, makes an appearance with the familiar and welcome slogging of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNothing to Say,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFopp,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUltramega OKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLouder than LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are all completely absent. On the other end of the spectrum, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth nothing that Grammy-nominated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPretty NooseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is also not present on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive on I5.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSo what does that leave? What it leaves is throaty, powerful versions of songs from the back half of SoundgardenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s catalogue, with a couple covers tossed in for good measure.\n\nChris Cornell, without the benefit of Pro Tools or Cool Edit or SAW (or whatever the Pentium 1 1996 equivalent of those was,) to enhance and refine his vocals is a very different singer. He still possesses all the raw power that is so memorable and iconic, but the sustained wails are replaced with choppy, bitten off notes. This entire experience sounds exactly like what the band would have been if not for A&amp;MÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s backing and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBadmotorfingerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-and-beyond huge budget. For fans of the first half of SoundgardenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legacy, this is a nice added perk, to hear what the hits would have sounded like on Sub Pop or SST. Listeners who know ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack Hole SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature song may find the change distasteful at first, but they might eventually think it a nice surprise to see the music they know played with reckless abandon and sung with unadulterated grit.\n\nThe other departure that makes this live effort separate from the studio records is the ubiquitous presence of Ben ShepherdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bass. No grunge band, save maybe the Melvins (and Buzz Osborne dislikes that label,) possessed a prevalent bass idiom. Yet here, Shepherd is practically forefront in the mix, aurally jacked to the nines for projection to a crowd. The end result has a more pronounced backbone, particularly during the extended and wandering solo of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlaves and Bulldozers,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or the quick and dirty cover of the StoogesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSearch and Destroy.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best turn comes right in the middle, as their cover of the BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHelter SkelterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ dovetails through similar chords into the somber, affecting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoot Camp.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The actual cover of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHelter SkelterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is average, as the band detunes the piece and wears away the sharp edges, but the way it changes to the suddenly similarly paced and equally morose ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoot CampÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is sublime.\n\nAlso of particular note is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRusty Cage,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which Cornell dedicates to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Man in Black;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Johnny Cash having covered it for his album that same year. The songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s normally ferocious first half is played with a blistering extra half-step of speed, not settling down until the song crashes into the doom-laden outro.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFell on Black DaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is executed with the necessary determined solemnity, a striking performance of what on record had always been an understated (and overplayed) song. Similarly, Soundgarden injects some creativity into super-single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack Hole Sun,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ playing it without percussion. The song ends up being much more haunting without the expected punctuation of cymbal and drum.\n\nLastly, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive on I5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ might feature the be-all-end-all performance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJesus Christ Pose.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The song has long been a favorite of dedicated Soundgarden connoisseurs, and the band doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t disappoint with this authoritative, pummeling version.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not all roses and cherries for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive on I5.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Most of the songs from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown on the UpsideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are well played but feel more detached. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBurden in My HandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a nice cut, but somewhat sterile, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDustyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is run of the mill and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTy CobbÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t offer anything the album version didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHead DownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has never been the best showcase for SoundgardenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability, and could easily have been supplanted by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmokestack Lightning.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlaves and BulldozersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has always been a brilliant piece, and musically still stands out on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive on I5,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but CornellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production-less vocals canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite crank that song like it exists on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBadmotorfinger.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWith all the rumors surfacing and in turn being buried about what Soundgarden might or might not be doing during this reunion, anything that can be proven in solid fact is worth exploring. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive on I5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ absolutely launches on March 22nd, and for fans new and old is a worthwhile addition to their collection. It is a portrait of one of the greatest bands in American music during the last twenty years, and was taken during the near apex of their dominion. Fans shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t miss this, and those who are too young to remember would be well served to start here.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fb3f51a148c8b6d3188db4eb8ea8249f52220c9","amp;dn":"Soundgarden+-+Live+On+I-5+%282011%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fb3f51a148c8b6d3188db4eb8ea8249f52220c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,179,245,26,20,140,139,109,49,136,219,78,184,234,130,73,245,34,32,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
