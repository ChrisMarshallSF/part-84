Laurel and Williamstown, New Jersey that began in 2008. Since then, they have released two EP's, an acoustic EP, a split with Boston pop punk band Transit, a compilation of old songs and a full length album. Taking influence from such pop punk acts as Blink-182, Saves the Day and Taking Back Sunday, Man Overboard play a brand of upbeat and poppy pop punk with the emotion of 90's emo acts such as The Promise Ring. The band is currently signed to Rise Records and are well known for their motto, &quot;Defend Pop Punk&quot;.\n(From Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Overboard_%28band%29)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63bdaabc5d1bc7f8c127f62353e1267e85a46dbf","amp;dn":"Man+Overboard+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63bdaabc5d1bc7f8c127f62353e1267e85a46dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,189,170,188,93,27,199,248,193,39,246,35,83,225,38,126,133,164,109,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
