Hailing from Texas, the singer-songwriter first picked up a guitar\nat the age of 15. He followed a common route, college and then singing on the side, moving around Texas in search \nof success. But his music is anything but common. He eventually returned to Houston, his hometown, and began to develop\n a following. That's where he released his first album, 2002's Flowers Liquor.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Carll has racked up a list of achievements, written three more full-lengths, \nand spent a good deal of time on the road, honing his craft and receiving inspiration. Carll has been named best folk\n and best new artist by the Houston Press, he's written music with Guy Clark and Ray Wylie Hubbard, and he's \nlargely recognized as a lead man in a resurgence of Texas artists greatly influenced by Townes Van Zandt and Bob Dylan.\n\nCarll's latest release is KMAG YOYO, a military acronym standing for &quot;Kiss My Ass Guys, You're on Your Own.&quot;\nListen to his set from WXPN's World Cafe Live, as part of the station's Live Fridays concert series.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2011/02/11/133660982/live-today-hayes-carll-in-concert&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2011/02/11/133660982/live-today-hayes-carll-in-concert&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUPPORT THE Artist buy his new cd.\n\n\nthis a promo upload for HAYES CARLL  new cd SUPPORT THE Artist buy his new cd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8567f776dcf7b74ff787751c2d9e6f87bd68260","amp;dn":"HAYES+CARLL+%28dvd%29+Live+IN+WXPN++World+Cafe++in+the+City++Philade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8567f776dcf7b74ff787751c2d9e6f87bd68260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,86,127,119,109,207,123,116,255,120,119,81,194,217,230,248,123,214,130,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
