This ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“liveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album is a representation of this special performance. Originally released on 2 CDs in France ONLY, the 1997 remastered edition (and subsequent releases) is now only available on a single CD internationally, with the original 2-CD edition now deleted and being a rare \ncollectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s item.\n\nThe Hong Kong ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“liveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album represents quite an interesting item - especially in the fact that the majority of the album release is not even taken from the Hong Kong concert! This album is, more-or-less, a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest of Europe In ConcertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ due to the majority of the tracks being taken from the European Tour Jarre performed during 1993, around most of EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s major cities. The only really true Hong Kong track on this album is Fishing Junks at Sunset, but even this was recorded from the rehearsals and not the actual live performance itself.\n\nAlso, due to a lack of CD space it would seem, Rendez-vous 2 is also missing from this album. which was actually performed at the concert.\n\nMusicians:\n\nJean Michel Jarre - Keyboards and Synthesizers\nFrancis Rimbert - Keyboards\nDominique Perrier - Keyboards\nSylvain Durand - Keyboards\nLaurent Faucheux - Drums\nDominique Mahut - persussions\nMichel Valy - Bass\nPatrick Rondat - Guitars\n\nSpecial Appearances:\n\nChuen Ying Arts Centre of Hong Kong - Chinese Orchestra\nCheng Chai-man - conductor\nHong Kong Opera Society - Choir\nJulie Lecrenais - child Soprano\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MirandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - voice of time\n\nCatalogue code number for edition:\n\nFrance:\nDisques Dreyfus - FDM 36154-2 - France only release; 2 CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70a805d816cccd7ae4075ac65a7ed83afe0fe015","amp;dn":"Jean+Michel+Jarre+-+Hong-Kong+%28Double+CD%29+%7B1995%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70a805d816cccd7ae4075ac65a7ed83afe0fe015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,168,5,216,22,204,205,122,228,7,90,198,90,126,216,58,254,15,224,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
