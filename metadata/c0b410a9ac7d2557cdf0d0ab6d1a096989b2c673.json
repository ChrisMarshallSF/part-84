Stage fright leads Alice down the rabbit hole, through a looking glass, and into a pool of her own tears in Wonderland. There she meets the oddest creatures imaginable: the frenetic Mad Hatter, the enigmatic Cheshire Cat, the mysterious Caterpillar, the murderous Queen of Hearts, and many others. Everything has a purpose and a lesson to teach Alice; but, although itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very funny, it's not all fun and games.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0b410a9ac7d2557cdf0d0ab6d1a096989b2c673","amp;dn":"Alice+In+Wonderland+%281999%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0b410a9ac7d2557cdf0d0ab6d1a096989b2c673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,180,16,169,172,125,37,87,205,240,208,171,109,26,9,105,137,178,198,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
