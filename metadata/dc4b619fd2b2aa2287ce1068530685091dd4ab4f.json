The monthly magazine was launched in October 1980 by Time Inc. Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be somewhat easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and science-oriented than magazines like Popular Science. Discover was left largely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s, but nevertheless decided to appeal to a wider audience, including more articles on psychology and psychiatry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc4b619fd2b2aa2287ce1068530685091dd4ab4f","amp;dn":"Discover+Magazine+-+March+2011+%28True+PDF%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc4b619fd2b2aa2287ce1068530685091dd4ab4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,75,97,159,210,178,170,34,135,206,16,104,83,6,133,9,29,212,171,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
