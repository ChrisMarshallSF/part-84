To be sure, Candlebox's take on grunge diluted the punk and indie elements inherent in its original form; instead, they were rooted in the bluesy, classic-style hard rock that grunge had ostensibly replaced. Their resulting commercial appeal made them highly suspect in the minds of authenticity-obsessed scenesters, and it didn't help matters that the band hadn't formed until well after the Seattle hype machine had begun. Nonetheless, Candlebox unwittingly helped usher in the post-grunge era; along with Bush, they showed how the more challenging aspects of grunge could be ironed out and polished into a sound that mainstream rock radio could embrace without reservation.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Don't You\n02.Change\n03.You\n04.No Sense\n05.Far Behind\n06.Blossom\n07.Arrow\n08.Rain\n09.Mother's Dream\n10.Cover Me\n11.He Calls Home\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edd7de5f9afc845536ea2cd97697dcee523bb367","amp;dn":"Candlebox+-+Candlebox+%281993%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edd7de5f9afc845536ea2cd97697dcee523bb367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,215,222,95,154,252,132,85,54,234,44,217,118,151,220,238,82,59,179,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
