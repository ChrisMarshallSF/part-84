Other All-In-One\nversions are often (read: almost all) based on the 32-bits version, which\nmakes it unable to use the Recovery Mode if you're on a 64-bits OS.\n\nFor a clean install: boot from ISO and just let the bootmenu timer pass\n(10 sec.). Setup will be started and you can also launch the Recovery Mode for\na 32-bits OS from there. If you use a 64-bits OS, in the bootmenu choose\n&quot;x64 Recovery Mode&quot; (don't use this for installation!).\nAlso with this version it's possible to upgrade from as well a 32-bits OS,\nas a 64-bits OS. Depending on the type of OS you use, the correct setup\nwill automatically be started.\nTested upgrade from Vista SP2 32-bits and 64-bits -&gt; OK.\nNOTE: the &quot;setup64.exe&quot; is not signed, this is correct!\n\nApart from combining the editions and above described elements, there\nare no modifications. All material is from the original MS ISOs\n(so not activated!). Activation can be done using a OEM or Retail productkey\n(except Enterprise editions). After a clean install or an upgrade, all\ninstalled files on the disk where Windows is installed are 100% original\nand untouched.\n\nActivation (located in Tools folder of .iso file)\n- mini Activator (1.072 by WZor) for Enterprise editions\n- Windows Loader (1.9.5 by Daz) for the other ones\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa1566bdcace5625aa33583df66718a248fff130","amp;dn":"WINDOWS+7+SP1+AiO+EN+DVD+x86+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa1566bdcace5625aa33583df66718a248fff130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,21,102,189,202,206,86,37,170,51,88,61,246,103,24,162,72,255,241,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
