Soon enough the fear grew even stronger after the terrorists have \nmade contact. They want ten billion Euro in 24 hours or they will blow up the entire Chernobyl \nnuclear power plant, releasing clouds of deadly, radioactive materials high into the atmosphere \nall over the northern hemisphere.\n\nTo pay such amount of money to the extremists is unthinkable. Frontal attack, however, could not \nbe thought about, either - the terrorists would have executed their plan if they saw attacking \nforces. There were too many of them and too well equipped for a quick military operation to succeed.\n\nOne possibility remained - to select the best Spec Ops single unit to sneak in and destroy enemy \ninstallation, preventing them from blowing up the Chernobyl and killing as many of them as \npossible. One man. \n\nYou.\n\nKey Features:\n\n*PC DVD-ROM First Person Perspective dynamic adventure shooter powered by the advanced Argon 4 technology.\n\n*Areas around the Prypiat, the city itself and the Chernobyl nuclear plant recreated.\n\n*Vivid, living environments with plant life, animals, birds and atmospheric effects.\n\n*Sophisticated enemy AI, allowing them to fight in groups, using different weapons and explosives, \n alarming and supporting each other, using terrain and objects in their tactics.\n\n*Explosive special effects.\n\n*Convincing storyline and action objectives. The player is constantly in contact with his HQ, \n which feeds him with data and changes mission objectives as he goes.\n\n*As the technology is very well tested and the team consists of professionals with long \n experience, the process of finishing, testing, localising and publishing the game should be most fluent.\n\nDuring 11 levels, player has to cross from the outskirts of Prypiat, through the entire town up \nto the Chernobyl Power Plant. The enemies get tougher and tougher, using RPG, camouflage (snipers), \nhelicopters and explosives. Gameplay gets intense, challenging - and fun.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\t\nSystem: Windows XP / Vista / 7\t\nCPU: Pentium 4 - 2,4 GHz\t\nRAM: 1 GB\t\nHard drive space: 4 GB\t\nVcard: 128MB with PS 3.0 support (GeForce 8600 or faster)\t\nScard: DirectX compatible\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Burn or mount ISO file\n2.Run &quot;Chernobyl_Setup.exe to install the game\n3.Copy/Replace crack Chernobyl.exe from POSTMORTEM folder to install directory\n4.Play the game\n\nScannedwith: Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 (Clean&amp;Tested)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcc51b150bb8ec1a895ee0beca5ffb41d6fbae1e","amp;dn":"Chernobyl+Terrorist+Attack+ISO+%5BPOSTMORTEM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcc51b150bb8ec1a895ee0beca5ffb41d6fbae1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,197,27,21,11,184,236,26,137,94,224,190,202,95,251,65,214,251,174,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
