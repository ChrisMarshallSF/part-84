What emerges is a moving self-portrait of an artist who sees himself as fundamentally misunderstood: He may have diagnosed thug life, but he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t invent it, and he is determined to upliftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not destroyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the black community.\n\nCapturing the intensity and passion of a fierce talent, TUPAC SHAKUR UNCENSORED AND UNCUT: THE LOST PRISON TAPES offers a glimpse inside the mind of the enigmatic artist whose music is, in his own words, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œall about life.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nScreenshots\n\n[IMG]http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/4702/snapshot20110223015021.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/2312/snapshot20110223015037.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/474/snapshot20110223015115.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/4246/snapshot20110223015123.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/5538/snapshot20110223015148.jpg[/IMG]\n\nAudio/ Video\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 552x416 29.92fps [Output 1]\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo 160Kbps [Output 2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15989069f5f171dc8672ed1fe2c57f5253f65718","amp;dn":"Tupac%7E+The+Lost+Prison+Tapes+%5B2011%5DDvdrip+-GOD-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15989069f5f171dc8672ed1fe2c57f5253f65718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,152,144,105,245,241,113,220,134,114,237,31,226,197,127,82,83,246,87,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
