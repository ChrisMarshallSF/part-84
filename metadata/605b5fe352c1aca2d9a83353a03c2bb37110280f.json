Though she dabbles in art, the lethargic Ofka chooses to work nights at a convenience store owned by her brother-in-law instead of studying for a career. But when her boyfriend jilts her and the store is robbed during her shift, Ofka gets a jolt in the direction of adulthood. As her self-absorption begins to dissipate, she starts to see things more clearlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like the fact that her friend Ubr loves her from afar. His crush goes unrequited, but Ofka rejects his advances with a kindness that signifies her progression from childishness to maturity. Though there is no grand revelation for Ofka, she feels the earth gradually shifting beneath her feetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½taking her closer to a place where she can hold on to those she loves.\n\nNight Owls was shot mainly in the Karlin district of Prague, where modern architecture has rapidly replaced the old, andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in screenwriter Irena HejdovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œeverything is changing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Cold, damp, and bleak as it seems, however, Ofka need only move out of the shadows and into the light of a doorway to discover a multitude of possibilities. The story of her awakening is a departure for director Michaela PavlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡tovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, better known for animated shorts that have garnered her both an Oscar nomination and a Golden Bear at the Berlinale.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1303215/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1303215/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFilesize: 1003.95 Mb ( 1 052 719 104 bytes )\nPlay length: 01:21:06.000 (121650 frames)\nSubtitles: Present (SubRip format)\nVideo: 704x360 (1.96:1), 25 fps, XviD MPEG-4 ~1496 kbps avg, 0.24 bit/pixel\nAudio: 48 kHz, AC3 Dolby Digital, 2/0 (L,R) ch, ~224.00 kbps avg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:605b5fe352c1aca2d9a83353a03c2bb37110280f","amp;dn":"Deti+noci+AKA+Night+Owls+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"605b5fe352c1aca2d9a83353a03c2bb37110280f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,91,95,227,82,193,172,162,217,168,51,83,160,60,43,179,113,16,40,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
