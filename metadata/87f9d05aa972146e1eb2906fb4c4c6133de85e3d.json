Our planet is home to a staggering number of thriving species. Back in the 19th Century, Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection helped explain how many of Earth's most resilient creatures adapted and evolved over the centuries. Unfortunately, it also raised countless questions, confusing even our most brilliant scientists. Beginning on the Galapagos Islands and venturing into the frozen heart of the Arctic, the NOVA crew watches as scientists use genetics to find out just how many of Darwin's radical theories still hold water today.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f9d05aa972146e1eb2906fb4c4c6133de85e3d","amp;dn":"What+Charles+Darwin+Never+Knew++%28Nova%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f9d05aa972146e1eb2906fb4c4c6133de85e3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,249,208,90,169,114,20,110,30,178,144,111,180,196,198,19,61,232,94,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
