As part of the process, you will observe some of the most famous people in the world through interrogator Greg Hartley's eyes. You'll discover what emotions these politicians, pundits, and stars are leaking through their body language and facial expressions, and what their answers (or non-answers) are really saying.\n\nI Can Read You Like a Book gives you the fastest, most efficient method to read body language. In any kind of face-to-face competition, first encounters or daily encounters, and even watching the news, you will spot the messages and emotions that people are really sending--whether they know it or not.\n\nAs a bonus, you will learn how to use your own face and body to your advantage, whether you're trying to evade a difficult question, handle a sensitive situation, or just playing poker!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd779849b07be8efe90d294833d31ee7e2a6317","amp;dn":"I+Can+Read+You+Like+a+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd779849b07be8efe90d294833d31ee7e2a6317","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,215,121,132,155,7,190,142,254,144,210,148,131,61,49,238,126,42,99,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
