Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.\n\n   19 &quot;After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'\n\n   21 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   22 &quot;The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'\n\n   23 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   24 &quot;Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'\n\n   26 &quot;His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.\n\n   28 &quot;'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nI am so tired of hearing this nonsense go back and forth, over and over again...\n\n&quot;This is better...

It's the latest version of a mature, product that I use whenever I need to copy disk partitions from one physical disk to another, resize partitions, or prepare disks for complex multiboot Windows installations. Paragon's app also backs up and restores anything from complete hard disks to the contents of any set of files you specify, wipes data from partitions or whole drives, and copies hard disks to disk images that can boot in VMware Workstation or Microsoft Virtual PC. This sort of sweeping hard disk management always entails some risk, but Paragon Hard Disk Manager 2010 comes with a confidence-inspiring set of safety features. It's the only disk-management utility I trust on my key systems. \n\n\nDisk Management Basics\n\nIf you're reading this review, you're probably not the kind of passive computer user who buys a machine with a single Drive C: partition on your hard drive, then never changes that basic setup. You probably know the advantages of dividing your disk into multiple partitions, and you don't need to be told that a &quot;partition&quot; is, essentially, a part of a physical disk that gets a drive letter to itself (though that's a rough-and-ready Windows-centric definition that doesn't cover all possibilities for partitions). \n\n\nI usually keep my hard disk divided into four or more partitions: one for my Windows XP system, one for my Windows 7 ($119.00 - $319.00 List, ) system, one for data only, one for long-term storage of installation programs and other large files. Depending on the system, I may sometimes even add additional partitions for other special purposes. I make daily backups of the partition I use for data, and less frequent backups of the other ones. \n\n\nManaging With Paragon\n\nParagon Hard Disk Manager has an interface much like other long-established disk management programs such as Easeus Partition Manager Professional 5. 0 and Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0, but I prefer the clarity of Paragon's UI. \n\nThe Express Interface leads directly to specific tasks, such as splitting or expanding existing partitions, wiping data from partitions or the free space on your drive, and backing up your e-mail or documents or whole drives to &quot;archive&quot; files. The express interface can also install a sophisticated boot manager that lets you boot Linux and Windows easily on the same disk. All these tasks can be performed with other tools, some of them available free, but I like the clarity and reliability of Paragon's wizards and the consistent reliability I've seen from its results. \n\nExperienced users will prefer the traditional hard-disk management dialog, with a tree-structured diagram of your disk structure at the top and a graph-style diagram of the disk at the bottom. Here you can right-click on a partition and choose from an enormous variety of tasks, including basic ones like renaming or testing a partition to such arcane tasks as changing the specific version of the NTFS file system used on a Windows partition. A partition explorer lets you extract files from external disks or from partitions that are normally hidden from Windows. For the really daring and the highly competent, a direct disk editor lets you change the actual bytes on your disk. A menu item lets you burn a bootable CD with a similar set of tools that you can use if your system gets damaged too badly to let you boot into Windows. \n\nParagon is my disk-manager of choice because of its excellent interface and because it's the only program of its kind that has always worked with all the hardware I could throw at it. Other packages I've tried have sometimes been unable to recognize some disks that I connected through Firewire or other uncommonly-used connection. Granted, most of those apps have since improved, but none can quite measure up to Paragon's ease of use and rigorous safety tools. \n\n\nWhat to Buy, and When\n\nI actually tested a near-final version of the $129.95 Professional version, which differs from the basic $49.95 Suite version in that it adds the ability to work with Dynamic Disks, a Windows feature more for corporate and enterprise installations than the home, school, or SOHO setting. That's why the screens say &quot;Professional;&quot; the versions are otherwise identical. Both versions should be available in final form within a few weeks after this review goes public, and if you buy the also highly recommended 2009 version now, you can upgrade for free to the 2010 version when it's released. The Professional version belongs in any IT manager's toolbox, and the Suite version is a multi-talented bargain that no advanced Windows user should be without.\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n                             Now, go save the World...\n\n                                 God, bless you...\n\n###################################################################################\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&lt;/a&gt;\n\n###################################################################################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cb5acf400244b09366fed04944d6e3a739e1522","amp;dn":"Paragon+-+Hard+Disk+Manager+2010+Professional+%28Build+9369%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cb5acf400244b09366fed04944d6e3a739e1522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,181,172,244,0,36,75,9,54,111,237,4,148,77,110,58,115,158,21,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
