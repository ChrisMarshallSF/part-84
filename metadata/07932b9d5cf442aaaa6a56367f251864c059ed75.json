He released two albums on Dandelion - &quot;Beau&quot; (1969) and &quot;Creation&quot; (1971) which featured Jim Milne and Steve Clayton from Tractor as backing musicians on some tracks, plus the single &quot;1917 Revolution&quot; which had greater success abroad than it did in the UK. &quot;1917 Revolution&quot; is said to have been the inspiration for America's &quot;A Horse With No Name&quot;.\nHis best known song however is probably &quot;The Roses Of Eyam&quot; (written under the name of John Trevor) which folk singer Roy Bailey took around the world and which he recorded on his &quot;Hard Times&quot; LP in 1985. This version was subsequently re-released on Bailey's &quot;Past Masters&quot; CD in 1998. (Beau himself released the song on his &quot;Lost Songs Found!&quot; CD in 2001.)\nBeau has produced several hundred songs, and has also recorded under the names of John Trevor and Trevor Midgley. Though mostly known as a &quot;folk&quot; performer, his writing has been also been strongly influenced by blues and rock.\nHe co-wrote &quot;WARHOL - The Musical&quot; with Steve Clayton of the band Tractor. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07932b9d5cf442aaaa6a56367f251864c059ed75","amp;dn":"Beau+-+Creation+%281972%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07932b9d5cf442aaaa6a56367f251864c059ed75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,147,43,157,92,244,66,170,170,106,86,54,127,37,24,100,192,89,237,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
