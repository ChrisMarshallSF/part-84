In 1860, the stingy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge who hates Christmas, loathes people, and defends the decrease of the surplus population runs his counting house exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit and clients, giving a bitter treatment to his own nephew and acquaintances. However, on this Christmas Eve he is visited by the doomed ghost of his former partner, Jacob Marley, who tells him that three spirits will visit him this night. The first one, the spirit of Christmas Past, recalls his miserable youth when he lost his only love due to his greed; the spirit of Christmas Present shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and how joyful life may be; and the spirit of Christmas Future shows him his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and time is too short and suddenly you are not there anymore, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew, and people in general. \n\n\nSource:\t\tDVD\nCategory:\tDrama, Musical, Fantasy\nStaring:\tAlbert Finney, Alec Guinness, Edith Evans\nCodec:\t\tx.264\nVideo Size:\t875 x 480 (Anamorphic encoding)\nFormat:\t\tNTSC\nAudio 1:\tDolby AC3 5.1 48000Hz 448 kb/s\nAudio 2:\tDolby AC3 48000Hz 192 kb/s 2-ch stereo\nLanguage:\tEnglish\nSubtitles:\tEnglish (soft-coded)\nLength:\t\t1:53:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b34a0e3eae7652d70caeabde78cb75d5e26facac","amp;dn":"Scrooge+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b34a0e3eae7652d70caeabde78cb75d5e26facac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,74,14,62,174,118,82,215,12,174,171,222,120,203,117,213,226,111,172,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
