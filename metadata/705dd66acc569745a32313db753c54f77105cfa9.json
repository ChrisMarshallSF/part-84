Maths and finance    \n    guru Alvin Hall came from an under-privileged             \n    background in the American South but has built a         \n    successful business and TV career, while                  \n    environmentalist Jane Poynter has worked on the            \n    International Space Station.                              \n                                                             \n    Hall is shocked by the mayhem and lack of punctuality     \n    from the Dream School kids. But, having laid down the      \n    law, he starts to inspire the kids by using money as a    \n    metaphor to make scary fractions and algebra a little    \n    more relevant.                                            \n                                                               \n    Nana Kwame, who left school with no GCSEs, turns out to   \n    be a whizz at maths, under the firm hand of his          \n    American tutor. And the magic of money maths also works   \n    for business-minded but similarly under-qualified          \n    Jourdelle, who impresses Alvin with his dedication and    \n    ability.                                                 \n                                                              \n    Dream School headmaster John D'Abbro requests the          \n    support of his two toughest-talking teachers - David      \n    Starkey and Alvin Hall - for an emergency assembly to    \n    address discipline at the school. But there are           \n    unexpected consequences when pupil Harlem launches a       \n    verbal attack on the headmaster and has to be sent home   \n    When she returns to school with her mother to sort       \n    things out with Jamie, and watch footage of her           \n    outburst, it's a sobering moment for parent and child.     \n                                                              \n    Jayne Poynter wants to move science out of the           \n    classroom. The scientist lived in a biosphere for two     \n    years, and wants four of the kids to live in their own     \n    biosphere for three days to understand how eco-systems    \n    work. But can they monitor oxygen levels, while          \n    ignoring encouragement from the other pupils to leave     \n    for a cigarette?                                           \n    And David Starkey's roller-coaster history course         \n    continues. Deciding that a noisy classroom of 20 is no   \n    way to engage students with his high-flying ideas, he     \n    tries Cambridge University-style one-on-one tutorials      \n    with a selected group, including Dream School's           \n    ubiquitous new academic high-flyer, Danielle.            \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.channel4.com/programmes/jamies-dream-school&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.channel4.com/programmes/jamies-dream-school&lt;/a&gt;     \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:705dd66acc569745a32313db753c54f77105cfa9","amp;dn":"Jamies.Dream.School.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"705dd66acc569745a32313db753c54f77105cfa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,93,214,106,204,86,151,69,163,35,19,219,117,60,84,247,113,5,207,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
