Still some growling here and there though.\n\nThird album is even more power metal, almost symphonic at times, slower tempo in general and not much growl at all.\n\nAll three records are _really good stuff_ though, so if you're a cross-genre listener you'll probably appreciate all three!\n\nToo bad they quit in 2005... let's hope they give it another try!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6938a2b33d781828230eb8ff67fc7aff30ad51b2","amp;dn":"Throne+of+Chaos+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6938a2b33d781828230eb8ff67fc7aff30ad51b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,56,162,179,61,120,24,40,35,14,184,255,103,252,122,255,48,173,81,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
