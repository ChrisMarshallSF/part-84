Some of the cuts swing pretty well in a bop-Django Reinhardt sort of fusion. &quot;Ragahantar&quot; and &quot;Ara-Be-In,&quot; by contrast, are fusions of jazz with middle-eastern music and a bit of a psychedelic rock drive.\n\nJerry Hahn (guitar); Michael White (violin); Noel Jewkes (flute, saxophone, tenor saxophone); Jack DeJohnette (drums).\n\n1.
