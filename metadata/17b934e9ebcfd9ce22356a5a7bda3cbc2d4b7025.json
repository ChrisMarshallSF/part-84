The title is a popular colloquialism for spies, as the series follows the work of a group of MI5 officers based at the service's Thames House headquarters, in a highly secure suite of offices known as The Grid. In the United States and France, the show is broadcast under the title MI-5. In Canada, the programme originally aired as MI5 but now airs on BBC Canada as Spooks.\n\nQuality: format: .mp4\n\nframe: 320 x 240\n\ndata rate: 255kbps (421 kbps total)\n\nframe rate: 24 fps\n\nAudio: 165 kbps\n\nchannels: 2 (stereo)\n\nsample rate: 48kHz\n\naverage file size: 181Mb.\n\nI am presently restricted to only 2Mbps u/l limit so please bear with me while this initially uploads.\n\nPlease seed for others to enjoy.
