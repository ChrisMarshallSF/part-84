Optimus, \nBulkhead, Arcee and Bumblebee Groundbridge to Agent Fowler's location. Now, Optimus has a trailer \n(which one looks like the Generation 1 trailer.) The Autobots transport the D.N.G.S.\n But, they are attacked by MECH a human orgainzation, who is lead by Silas.\n Meanwhile, Soundwave picks up a signal of the Autobots and Starscream sends a group of Vehicons to destroy them.\n The Autobots try many things to get rid of MECH and can't. Until, Bumblebee puts the D.N.G.S. on a train.\n The Vehicons attack, meaning the Autobots must stop them. When, one Vehicon hits Optimus with a log Optimus tumbles to the ground.\n MECH picks up the D.N.G.S.' signal and shuts down Raf. Ratchet Groundbridges Miko and Jack to help solve this problem.\n Optimus realizes that MECH is heading for the train. He transforms and drives there, as fast as he can. MECH spots Optimus and retreats, \nbut shoots a missile at the track the train is on. If Optimus doesn't save Miko and Jack they will die.\n So, he jumps in front of the train and tries pushing it as back as he can. His work is a success.\n Silas scans Optimus and now wants to find out what makes him tick. Optimus states that there are Decepticons who are in Human skin.\n\nFirst Appearances: Silas and MECH\n\nNote: Having Humans being villains is a reference to Transformers Animated.  \n\nSpoken Language:- English\n====================================================================================\n\nCast\n===========\nSeries cast summary: \n----------------------\n\n  Kevin Michael Richardson  ...

Transforms into a red semi-trailer truck. \nIt was also shown in the &quot;Introducing The Hub&quot; commercial that Optimus Prime has a mouth feature, \nlike in Transformers Animated and the live action films, but Prime can also access\n a mouth plate feature as seen in most of the pictures on the internet.\n\nArcee: A female Autobot. Transforms into a blue motorcycle. Arcee is the smallest and most \nagile of the Autobot team. Acts as vice commander of the team.\n\nBumblebee: Transforms into a camaro similar to the live action movie except with an engine block in the hood.\n As in the live action movies, Bumblebee communicates through electronic sound effects rather than specific human languages.\n\n\nRatchet: Team medic. Transforms into a hybrid medical truck. His appearance and attitude is \nsimilar to his Transformers Animated character.\n\nBulkhead: Transforms into a giant green ATV. Like Ratchet, Bulkhead's appearance is similar \nto the Transformers Animated character.\n\nCliffjumper: Transforms into a red Dodge Challenger, killed off in the first episode with\n his body used in testing Dark Energon.\n\nDecepticons\n--------------\nMegatron: Leader of the Decepticons, transforms into a Cybertronian jet, similar the live action\n version. He believes that Earth-style forms are beneath him and attempts to utilize the Dark Energon \nhe acquired from his time in space to end these &quot;War Charades&quot; with the\n Autobots in his favor.\n\nStarscream: Transforms into a silver gray a F-16 Fighting Falcon-like fighter. He is colored silver\n instead of the frequently used red and blue. Starscream shows respect for his commander, but waits for\n a chance to kill Megatron and take over leadership of the Decepticons.\n\nSoundwave: Transforms into a blue MQ-9 Reaper-type aircraft. His arms become the wings, resulting in \nthem becoming very thin. According to his bio, he can use &quot;deployers&quot; that come out from his chest along \nwith mechanical tentacles. Soundwave's robotic appearance is similar\n to Jetstorm from Beast Machines.\n\nRatbat: (no info atm)\n\nEradicons: Troops (also known as drones) who serve as foot soldiers for the Decepticons.\n They transform into purple muscle cars.\n\nOthers\n----------\nUnicron: Only mentioned in the series so far, this is also where the Dark Energon Megatron uses eminates\n from. Dark Energon can revive the dead.\n\nHumans\n--------------\nJackson &quot;Jack&quot; Darby: a 16 year old boy who accidentally encounters Arcee in her motorcycle form and enters\n into the Transformer War as a strong ally.\n\nMiko Nakadai: Miko's last name is Nakadai, but at Comic Con 2010, it said that Miko's last name was Tezuka.\n 15 year old female Japanese exchange student who seeks to be &quot;in on the action&quot; after seeing Arcee.\n Later shows mechnical aptitude.\n\nRafael &quot;Raf&quot; Esquivel: A very young computer whiz who is able to provide Ratchet the technical support \nfor human technical devices that Ratchet cannot develop. Ratchet comes to respect Raf rather than a &quot;fleshy&quot;,\n becoming actual friend who actively support each other in later episodes. \nSeems to be the only one who understands Bumblebee.\n\nSpecial Agent Fowler: The Autobots' liaison to the outside world who only visits when there are &quot;issues&quot;\n like that of the Autobots failing to keep their fight with the Decepticons off the radar.\n\nJune Darby: Jack's mother.\n\n==========================================================================================\n[/center]\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace on irc.cartoonpalace.info for more Cartoons and Anime.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36c10cb7f0f8f04d76a3d53066ffec9292051354","amp;dn":"Transformers.Prime.S01E09.Convoy.720p.WEB.DL.DD5.1.AAC2.0.H264.B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36c10cb7f0f8f04d76a3d53066ffec9292051354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,193,12,183,240,248,240,77,118,163,213,48,102,255,236,146,146,5,19,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
