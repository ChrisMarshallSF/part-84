The \ncase was one of the first that shined a spotlight on what many called the \n&quot;legal lynchings&quot; that occurred in the South whenever blacks were accused \nof crimes, especially against whites and most especially against white women.\n\nCast\nCredited cast:\nAndre Braugher \tAndre Braugher \t... \t\nNarrator (voice)\nRest of cast listed alphabetically:\nNesbitt Blaisdell \tNesbitt Blaisdell \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nSam Catlin \tSam Catlin \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nJeffrey DeMunn \tJeffrey DeMunn \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nFrances McDormand \tFrances McDormand \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nDaver Morrison \tDaver Morrison \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nStanley Tucci \tStanley Tucci \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nLee Wilkof \tLee Wilkof \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nHarris Yulin \tHarris Yulin \t... \t\nVoices (voice)\nFull cast and crew  \n\nStats:\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.36 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 277 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate                         : 2 073 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.225\nStream size                      : 1.24 GiB (91%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 61\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 118 MiB (8%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\n\nRelease notes:\nenjoy!\n\n\n                                                                     \n                                                             \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                       \n      \n              Greetz from Team FiCO:               \n              \n                                                             \n                                                             \n           BLooDWeiSeR,CULTXviD,SiCK,DoNE,LAP,TH30R1STS              \n                                                                             \n               WinBeta, DvF, WASTE, BERC, KALEVALA, Jiggly                   \n                                                                             \n                                                             \n                                       \n                             \n                      \n                  \n           \n            \n                    \n                  \n                \n                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                    \n                                                              \n                      you know where to find us...                     \n                        \n   NFO By: CoaXCable/CoolPHat &lt;#CPH&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2895bc7cca403f1175a1f787a39cc76ea768768","amp;dn":"Scottsboro.An.American.Tragedy.2000.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2895bc7cca403f1175a1f787a39cc76ea768768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,137,91,199,204,164,3,241,23,90,31,120,122,57,204,118,234,118,135,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
