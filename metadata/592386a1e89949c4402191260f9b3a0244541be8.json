WHEN I UPGRADED TO A NEW HP AND WINDOWS 7, \n\nWAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT WINDOWS PHOTO GALLERY WAS NOW &quot;WINDOWS LIVE PHOTO GALLERY&quot;.  I tried and tried but I just\n \ndidn't care for it.  FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME LAST SUMMER MICROSOFT ALLOWED \n\nONE TO HAVE BOTH THE WINDOWS PHOTO GALLERY AND THE WINDOWS LIVE PHOTO\n GALLERY.  NOT ANY MORE.   THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE BUT GUESS WHAT PHOTO \n\nGALLERY LOVERS, HERE IT IS.   DO NOT LET THE NAME FOOL YOU.  IT'S TITLED \n\nWINDOWS LIVE PHOTO GALLERY BUT IT IS THE OLD TRIED AND TRUE.   HOPE SOMEONE \n\nBESIDES ME IS HAPPY.   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592386a1e89949c4402191260f9b3a0244541be8","amp;dn":"WINDOWS+PHOTO+GALLERY+%7BOLD+VERSION%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592386a1e89949c4402191260f9b3a0244541be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,35,134,161,232,153,73,196,64,33,145,38,15,155,58,2,68,84,27,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
