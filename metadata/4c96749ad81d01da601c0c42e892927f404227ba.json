Includes the best artwork, covers, inserts, etc. that I could find. There seems to be 2 variations of the Cover itself, one green one yellow, but I believe all tracks are of the same catalog # : MM 80007-2. My guess is one is the re-release.\n\nAlso, the tracklist is as it appears on the album, the 2 additional tracks not on the list are marked as Bonus and track 8 has been corrected(artist &amp; title reversed).\n\nAs for track 6, we chose to leave the artist as the album credits(Red 1) as oposed to Dave Clarke.\n\nTracks.\n\nVarious - Psychotrance\nLabel:Moonshine Music\nCatalog#:MM 80007-2\nFormat:CD, Mixed, Compilation\nCountry:US\nReleased:28 Mar 1994\nGenre:Electronic\nStyle:Trance, Techno\n\nTracklist\n1 Union Jack - Lollipop Man 6:08\nWritten-By, Producer - Claudio* , Simon Berry\n2 Somnambulist - Nightflyte 3:25\nWritten-By, Producer - Krypto , Mantrac\n3 Terminator/Benelux* - The Warrant 2:50\nWritten-By, Producer - Hilary , RSF*\n4 Megalon - Sorcerer 5:09\nWritten-By, Producer - Pantelli* , Zed (8)\n5 Baruka - Play It Loud 4:35\nWritten-By, Producer - Baruka\n6 Dave Clarke - Zeno Xero 4:10\nWritten-By, Producer - Dave Clarke\n7 Megalon - Darkness 7:06\nWritten-By, Producer - Pantelli* , Zed (8)\n8 Razor's Edge - Sleepless 4:30\nWritten-By, Producer - Doug Osborne\n9 Baby Doc &amp; The Dentist - Catalan Rising 3:25\nWritten-By, Producer - Baby Doc And The Dentist*\n10 Underground Science - Photosynthesis 3:23\nWritten-By, Producer - Hijacker , Krypto , Kumo , Rameses\n11 Keoki &amp; High &amp; Lonesome Soundsystem, The* - Take It 5:19\nWritten-By, Producer - High And Lonesome Soundsystem, The* , Keoki\n12 Lazonby* - Sacred Cycles 5:31\nWritten-By, Producer - Pete Lazonby\n13 Krypto - Sierra Nevada 5:11\nWritten-By, Producer - Krypto , Arlow* , Holmes*\n14 Hyperspace - Europa 5:37\nWritten-By, Producer - Baby Doc And The Dentist*\n15 NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼w Idol - WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ Maze 5:00\nWritten-By, Producer - Mr. Mo (3)\n\n6: credited as &quot;Red 1 - Xeno Ero&quot;\n8: artist &amp; track title are switched on the cover\n\nTrack times obtained via computer music player software.
