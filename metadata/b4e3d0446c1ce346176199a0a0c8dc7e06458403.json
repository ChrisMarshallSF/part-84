This talk will review recent events in the kernel development community, discuss the current state of the kernel and the challenges it faces, and look forward to how the kernel may address those challenges. Attendees of any technical ability should gain a better understanding of how the kernel got to its current state and what can be expected in the near future.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/kernel_dev&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fosdem.org/2011/schedule/event/kernel_dev&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e3d0446c1ce346176199a0a0c8dc7e06458403","amp;dn":"FOSDEM.2011.Corbet.kernel-development.xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e3d0446c1ce346176199a0a0c8dc7e06458403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,227,208,68,108,28,227,70,23,97,153,160,160,200,220,126,6,69,132,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
