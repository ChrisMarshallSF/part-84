Once again, I have never seen a torrent up for MP3 converted versions of this live show so this is my present to all of you.\n\nSongs in order are:\n\nBounce\n\nAerials\n\nChop Suey! (or as real fans know it 'Suicide')\n\nDeer Dance\n\nNeedles\n\nPsycho (with Darons amazing solo)\n\nSuggestions\n\nSuite Pee\n\nToxicity (with Goodbye Blue Sky)\n\nOnce again I will state that there is only one song missing, 'Mind', because the person who uploaded it to youtube put the 'Star Wars' theme at the begining of it. I won't rip it because I find that disrespectful and if any one can find me a better version on youtube, congrats and lemme know. I hope you all enjoy these once again and I'm sorry for messing up the last one.\n\nThanks, and remember to seed! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cbdfde60eaad5f8e71fe21a144cd2332f277206","amp;dn":"System+of+a+Down+Live%40+Big+Day+Out%21+02+MP3+%28Fixed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cbdfde60eaad5f8e71fe21a144cd2332f277206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,189,253,230,14,170,213,248,231,31,226,26,20,76,210,51,47,39,114,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
