Whatever measures of ignorance, greed, wishful thinking, we have put ourselves at a crossroad, which offers two paths with dire consequences. If we continue to burn fossil fuels we will choke the life out of the planet and if we don't our way of life will collapse. \n\nWritten by Adolfo Doring and featuring William Catton Jr., Max Fraad Wolff, Richard Heinberg, Kenneth Deffeyes, Albert Bartlett, Roscoe Bartlett, James Hansen, David Pimentel, Joseph Tainter, David Korten, Jason Bradford, Elke Weber, Mary-Ann Hitt, Terry Tamminen, Ted Caplow and Derrick Jensen.\n\nThat's quite a star cast for discussing things like peak oil, global warming and societal collapse. This documentary delves into the psychology that is causing the cocktail of converging crises that human society is facing in my opinion. Very little is left out.\n\nIf you liked documentaries such as The Century of the Self, The Corporation, Life at the End of the Empire, Darwin's Nightmare, and Blue Gold: World Water Wars, then you will like this one too, itÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Âº an eye- and mind-opener.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba902914fba8806f4bcfbf8e9db81394c8d6413a","amp;dn":"BLIND+SPOT+%282008%29+EN.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba902914fba8806f4bcfbf8e9db81394c8d6413a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,144,41,20,251,168,128,111,75,207,191,142,157,184,19,148,200,214,65,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
