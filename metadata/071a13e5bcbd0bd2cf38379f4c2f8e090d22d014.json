Since centuries the life of the people that live here is intricately tied in with the drug hashish. Hashish as daily labour, hashish as a bartering good, hashish as business, hashish as the basis and philosophy of a social system, hashish as the medium of dreams and hashish as the reason for stagnation.\n\nThe film sketches a portrait of this life: a look at work and daily family life; the drug; music and landscape as a metaphysical projection surface; the question of freedom in a globalized world; and, at the core of the film, the stories of the people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071a13e5bcbd0bd2cf38379f4c2f8e090d22d014","amp;dn":"Daniel+Grabner+-+Haschisch+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071a13e5bcbd0bd2cf38379f4c2f8e090d22d014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,26,19,229,188,189,11,210,207,56,55,159,76,47,142,9,13,34,208,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
