Northcote Parkinson.\n\n[The Life and Times of Jeeves]\n\nNOT P.G. Wodehouse.\n\nTaken from cassette, so quality is not the best. Approx. 2 hours.\nI've left the music at the beginning and end but removed it from the other sides.\n\nRead by Gerald Harper, with:\nFrank Duncan as Jeeves\nKeith Alexander as Bertie Wooster\n\nAnd a large supporting cast. Details, with cover scan, included.\n\nI hope this isn't a third copy as Demonoid has rejected the first two attempts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dffdd78a8ee8b36b3088e61bbf774ade19745baa","amp;dn":"Jeeves+-+A+Gentleman%5C%27s+Personal+Gentleman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dffdd78a8ee8b36b3088e61bbf774ade19745baa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,253,215,138,142,232,179,107,48,136,230,27,191,119,74,222,25,116,91,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
