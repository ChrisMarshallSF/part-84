He is gradually restored to health by a beautiful young nurse. When they find themselves falling in love, they try to escape the horrors of the war by fleeing to Swizerland to seek peace and happiness. There, fate is waiting to thwart their plans. This poignant and tragic love story, based on Ernest Hemmingway's famous novel is brought to the screen in a spectacular production by David O. Selznick (producer of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;), and features stunning action sequences. \n\n\nBesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶k *--| TankaNer . com |--* fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r mer filmer och serier!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e92fb7c9d4bc4bacf72a95fa2912058cfc2ce9e3","amp;dn":"Farv%C3%83%C2%A4l.Till.Vapen.1957.SWESUB.DVDRip.Xvid-Sweden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e92fb7c9d4bc4bacf72a95fa2912058cfc2ce9e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,47,183,201,212,188,75,172,247,42,149,250,41,18,5,140,252,44,233,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
