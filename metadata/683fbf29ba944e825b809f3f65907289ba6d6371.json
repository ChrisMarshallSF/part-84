In the 1970's, a group of ruthless Irish punks called the Westies, terrorized the Hell's Kitchen section of New York City. Young Irish thug Jimmy Coonan teamed up with Billy &quot;The Indian&quot; Bokun, Eddie &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cummiskey and Mickey Featherstone, a Vietnam veteran who already had a reputation for being a ruthless killer. They became so powerful the Gambino crime family formed an alliance with the Westies and used them as contract killers. But it wasn't long before the killing got out of control. \n\n\n\nThe great 1990 film &quot;State of Grace&quot; starring Sean Penn is loosely based on the Westies. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor. Although a flop at the box office, Roger Ebert believed the difficulty State of Grace had was due to another film with the same theme being released the same week, Martin Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:683fbf29ba944e825b809f3f65907289ba6d6371","amp;dn":"Mobsters+-+2x03+-+The+Westies+%282007%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"683fbf29ba944e825b809f3f65907289ba6d6371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,63,191,41,186,148,78,130,91,128,159,63,101,144,114,137,186,109,99,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
