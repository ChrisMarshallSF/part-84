With them are the instructions for reading them.  They are compressed with 7-zip LZMA and LZMA2 formats to reduce their size to roughly half of the originals.  Decompressed, they are the exact same as the rar version.\nIf you doubt me, feel free to download both versions and compare for yourself while leaving a comment for the rest of us.\n\nProps go to Anonymous!\n\nStay tuned for the Greg e-mails next!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9ff1fe7c2ffbd2847e47260609f43317eb10153","amp;dn":"HBGary+leaked+emails+-+Aaron%2C+Phil+and+Ted+-+7-zip+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9ff1fe7c2ffbd2847e47260609f43317eb10153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,255,31,231,194,255,189,40,71,228,114,96,96,159,67,49,126,177,1,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
