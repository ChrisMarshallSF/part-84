A combination of sexual and religious imagery, it caused a scandal in Belgium and was banned in France. It is the story of a young man in search for a cross who eventually has one tailor made. Even with the support of the Kinsey Institute, it proved impossible to have the film shown in the United States.\nThe film's title is a reference to The Imitation of Christ.\n\nCast\nConrad Altenloh\t\nPaul Bourgoignie\t\nSuzanne Bourgoignie\t\nJosette Brunet\t\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©o Dohmen\t\nJane Graverol\t\nTom Gutt\t\nWout Hoeboer\t\nUlysse PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tiau\t\nGeo Ramusse\t\nSerge Treblich","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7620f13bf1abed95ed4ba91b8353035706d08d","amp;dn":"+L%5C%27Imitation+du+Cin%C3%83%C2%A9ma+AKA+The+Imitation+Of+Cinema+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7620f13bf1abed95ed4ba91b8353035706d08d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,118,32,241,59,241,171,237,149,237,75,169,27,131,83,3,87,6,208,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
