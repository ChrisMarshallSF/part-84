Throughout the season, Dean and Sam battle both angels and demons as they fight their destiny to become the vessels of Michael and Lucifer. Unable to defeat Lucifer, they collect the rings of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which act as the keys to Lucifer's prison. The idea of destiny versus freedom and choice play a big role. Throughout the season, Dean, Sam, Castiel, and Bobby each have a crisis as they near giving up. However, through each other's support, they continue forward until the end.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298db11c847476410012d19ec05b8da527e6812e","amp;dn":"Supernatural+Season+5%5BDvDRip%5D%5BChris%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298db11c847476410012d19ec05b8da527e6812e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,141,177,28,132,116,118,65,0,18,209,158,192,91,141,165,39,230,129,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
