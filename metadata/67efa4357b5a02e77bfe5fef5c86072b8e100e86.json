super-chilled  air\n        towards the earth and sets off a catastrophic chain of  events\n        that threatens to engulf the world in ice!\n\n        Jack Tate is a brilliant, yet troubled, physicist specialising\n        in Earth Sciences.  He provides the  land-based support for  a\n        research vessel in the Antarctic Ocean. One hundred miles  off\n        the coast  of Australia,  Jack's colleagues  are studying  the\n        vast thinning of the ozone layer. Without warning, a blast  of\n        sub-zero air strikes the vessel, flash freezing the scientists\n        and crew.  As Jack  pieces together  the chain  of events, the\n        deadly and ever-growing ice-cold air mass envelopes cities and\n        Jack becomes the  planet's last chance  to stop the  impending\n        ice age.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                   Michael Shanks    ....
