The group had a huge Southern California following and in 1970 they scored a deal with Warner Bros., which would issue the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first 11 albums, from 1971ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Little Feat through 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Representing The Mambo. After the second album, Estrada left, and Paul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, Kenny Gradney, and Sam Clayton became members.\n\nFollowing LowellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in 1979, the group wrapped up an album in the works, then they each went off to do other things, which included an enormous amount of session work for other major recording artists.\n\nIt surprised everyone when the band re-emerged in the late ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢80s with its unique musical vision intact.\n\nThe four-CD Hotcakes &amp; Outtakes boxed set celebrates the 30th anniversary of this West Coast outfit and covers all the phases, stages, and hiatuses, right up to the late ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢90s. \n\nDiscs 1 &amp; 2 represent the classic Warner Bros. years, with Lowell George at the helm; disc 3 gathers highlights from all of the albums the group has made since their 1988 reunion and disc 4 is entirely comprised of previously unreleased Lowell George-era rarities recently found in the Warner Bros. vaults.\n\nCoproduced by band members Bill Payne and Paul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, the box also features a booklet containing a prodigious history by Bud Scoppa, with tons of fresh quotes from the group, notes about the newly discovered material by BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, detailed track info and lots of rare photos. In a word, the box dishes up the whole steaming Little Feat saga in one heaping helping. For long-suffering Feat fans, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;All You Can Dream&quot;!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1  \n\n01. Strawberry Flats  \n02. Hamburger Midnight  \n03. Easy To Slip  \n04.
