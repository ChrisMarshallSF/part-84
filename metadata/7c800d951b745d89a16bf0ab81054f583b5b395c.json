Quickly and easily browse and find photos, and fix red-eye, lighting and more with easy-to-use editing tools. Then share your best through e-mail, prints or your own personal space on ACDSeeOnline.com.\n&quot;The program is great. It basically covers everything you would want to do with photos. &quot;\n- Rick Stickles, Sudbury, Ontario\nView fast\nACDSee 12's viewing speed is second to none. Open photos from anywhere on your computer or e-mail with the fastest image viewing technology available. That means you spend less time waiting for your photos to load and more time enjoying them. Zoom through your latest shots, browse instant slide showsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and enjoy full-size previews. Looking at your photos has never been this fun or this fast.\n\nBrowse your collection\nBrowse all your photos right away. Unlike catalog-based photo applications, you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to waste valuable time importing files that are already on your computer and connected devices. Access your folders and files live, in real time. Sort, group and filter photos by camera information, edited state or other criteria for super fast scanning. You can also browse by date or event to see photos from a specific occasion.\nOrganize from the start\nHit the ground running. Specify categories, add keywords and create backups as you upload photos from your camera, card reader or other device. When importing is done, your images are ready for you to browse and share.\nManage everything in one place\nBring together over 100 file types into one convenient place. View, manage, and get extensive format support for your photos, audio, and video clips including BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, PSD, MP3, MPEG, TIFF, WAV and many others. Take a look at the complete list of supported file formats.\n&quot;I think ACDSee is the best, most complete and reliable software.&quot;\n- Marcos Molina, Palma de Mallorca, Spain\n\nKeep track of all your photos\nManage your collection the way that works best for you. Unlike other photo software, ACDSee doesn't impose a one-size-fits-all organization system. Create your own categories and keywords, mark favorites, edit your metadata, and rate your shots. Rename, resize, rotate, or edit file information on groups of photos at once. Plus tag your best photos and bring them all together for further editing or sharing.\n\nFind any photo\nACDSee 12's powerful search tools can help you find any photo, even if you have thousands in your collection. Enter keyword phrases like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsummer vacationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œschool playÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, search only specific folders, and find that one special image with the Quick Search bar. Or perform more detailed searches and save them for ongoing use.\n&quot;As an avid digital photographer with just under 23,000 digital photos, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important that I have a great tool for keeping things organized. The search function is excellent and very fast, and when you have as many photos as I do, speed matters.&quot;\n- Jason Dunn, Executive Editor, Digital Home Thoughts\nPerfect your photos with easy-to-use editing tools\nInstantly correct exposure, fix red eye, and erase unwanted objects. Rescue photos that are too light or dark with a single click. Turn your photos black and white, add text, and put a finishing touch such as a vignette, border or drop shadow. Apply creative effects to selected areas of your photos. Edit with the peace of mind that your original files are never altered. With ACDSee, it's never too late to achieve the shot you were hoping to get. \n\nLooking for even more editing power such as non-destructive editing, batch processing, or RAW processing? Then ACDSee Pro is for you.\n\nPublish and store photos online\nIt's easier than ever to share your photos with friends and family online.
