Hell, it managed to hold two over-worked jury members in a room for two and a half hours before the MFF 2002 - what more can we say?&quot;. As of 2003, Machinima.com planned to release the film on DVD with extra footage and artwork.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb171ba7f0f75ab5a60113d4d89aeca79f3cd4f","amp;dn":"Anachronox+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb171ba7f0f75ab5a60113d4d89aeca79f3cd4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,177,113,186,127,15,117,171,90,96,17,61,77,137,174,202,121,243,205,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
