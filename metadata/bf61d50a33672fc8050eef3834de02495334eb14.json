ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s partly due to the low-key production and the smoothness of her vocals, but most of all this is an album that flows effortlessly through all 14 songs making this feel like an extended song cycle rather than a collection of individual tracks.\nThis warmth and familiarity gives the disc a real immediacy and from the very first track this is an album that feels lived in and comfortable, but a few listens in and the real charms begin to show themselves, the lyrics begin to hit home with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Come HomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ a plea to a soldier stationed abroad, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Gray Sky GirlsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ a beautiful commentary on modern city living.\nIn fact, for all its low-key acoustic Americana feel, this is an album that can challenge the listener with its lyrics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly a writer with a gentle touch, but in the main this is a clever, poetic and at times political record that is full of genuine heart and character.\nThese are all NaomiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own songs with the exception of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Sea of HeartbreakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which is a track that fits in seamlessly to flow created by the first trio of songs.\nThere are a number of musicians who add to the album, most notably some delicate dobro from Al Perkins, but in general this is an album more than the sum of its parts, and at times the mixture of her own vocals and backing instrumentation create a warm and unique atmosphere which is both effortless and engaging.\nWhile sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a name new to many, this is an album that deserves to hold its head up against any Americana or singer/songwriter album in recent memory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a mature, thoughtful and thoroughly enjoyable disc.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/08/naomi-sommers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/08/naomi-sommers/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf61d50a33672fc8050eef3834de02495334eb14","amp;dn":"Naomi+Sommers...Gentle+as+the+Sun%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf61d50a33672fc8050eef3834de02495334eb14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,97,213,10,51,103,47,200,5,14,239,56,52,222,2,73,83,52,235,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
