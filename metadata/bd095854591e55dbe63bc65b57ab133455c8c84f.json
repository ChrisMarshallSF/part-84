Upon their arrival, however, the group is confronted with the ancient folklore legend of Tore Gravik. Many years ago in these woods, this mentally unstable man killed his own sister (with whom he was in love) and her lover, before vanishing into the woods never to be heard about again. Soon enough, the group witnesses strange occurrences and sense an invisible presence. Prominent intellectuals like them naturally don't believe in urban legends. Or do they? The essence of this movie's powerful and everlasting impact lies within ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ surprise, surprise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ its simplicity! &quot;Lake of the Dead&quot; tells a very rudimentary story and features ordinary and identifiable people as the main characters. These people show naturally common signs of fear and hypocrisy and they do what any normal person would do in perilous condition. Another brilliant quality is the use of the breathtaking sets and locations. Director Kare Bergstrom introduces the cabin in the woods and the nearby lake like additional and vital characters in the story and they demand more than a fair share of your attention. The tone of the film is continuously ominous and the overall atmosphere is creepy &amp; unsettling beyond description. I've rarely witnessed a movie that grabbed my attention as profoundly as &quot;Lake of the Dead&quot;. The conclusion of the film is psychologically astounding\n\n [/i][/color][/b]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://img5.imagebanana.com/img/5cn5l8s/vlcsnap120714.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img5.imagebanana.com/img/4f2jkv0k/vlcsnap121804.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img5.imagebanana.com/img/127dzld/vlcsnap206864.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[CODE]\nVideo:\navi XviD Mpeg4 visual\nBitrate: 1 521 Kbps\nWxH: 704x288 pixels\nAspect ratio: 2.444\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.300\n\nAudio:\nMp3 VBR stereo\nBit rate: 171 Kbps\nNormal: 192 Kbps\n[/CODE]\n\n\n\n[i][b][color=blue]Thanks to MrElg for the rip\n20 kb/s 24/7 \nenglish softsubs included[/color][/b][/i]\n\n\n[IMG]http://img5.imagebanana.com/img/7gewaccz/vlcsnap121537.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd095854591e55dbe63bc65b57ab133455c8c84f","amp;dn":"Lake+of+the+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd095854591e55dbe63bc65b57ab133455c8c84f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,9,88,84,89,30,85,219,230,59,198,91,87,171,19,52,85,200,200,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
