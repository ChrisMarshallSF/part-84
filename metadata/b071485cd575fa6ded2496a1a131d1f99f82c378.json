Attrici comiche e suffragette\nA Hundred Years ago - Comic Actresses and Suffragettes\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cinetecadibologna.it/imageserver/lightboxenlarge/files/lumiere/giugno2010/100_anni.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cinetecadibologna.it/imageserver/lightboxenlarge/files/lumiere/giugno2010/100_anni.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe first golden age of cinema comedy began in 1910, when the women's rights movement was expanding and around the world people were re-thinking gender roles, love, social relationships and attitudes to domestic responsibilities.\n\n\n\nIn the vaults of international archives we discovered a unique legacy: films featuring the first generation of female comedy stars such as Tilly and Sally, Cunegonde, Mistinguett, Rosalie, Lea and Gigetta. Sixteen of these irresistible comedies were selected for the DVD, along with contemporary newsreel footage of suffragette action in the UK and USA.\n\n\n\nComing to us from a hundred years ago, the films are not only first-rate documents but strikingly relevant even today. Fresh, fun and surprisingly unbuttoned in their approach, they can liberate through laughter. They demonstrate how the new mass medium of cinema, a highly popular amusement in 1910, related crucially to its audience's existential concerns, offering new role models and counter-models and of course wonderful entertainment.\n\n# La Doctoresse (Georges Monca, 1910).\n\n# Les Ficelles de Leontine (1910).\n\n\n# Les Timidites de Rigadin (Georges Monca, 1910).\n\n# Rosalie et Leontine vont au theatre (Romeo Bosetti, 1911).\n\n# LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ontine est incorrigible\n\n# Tilly and the Fire Engines (Lewin Fitzhamon, 1911).\n\n# Tilly in a Boarding House (Lewin Fitzhamon, 1911).\n\n# Le torchon brule (Romeo Bosetti, 1911).\n\n# Cunegonde Has Visitors (1912).\n\n\n# Les Femmes deputees (1912).\n\n\n# Lea si diverte (1912).\n\n# La nuova cameriere e troppo bella (1912).\n\n# Che paese allegro!
