Yet this humble     \n         creature is at the very center of a collision between three   \n         completely different species. For many decades, humans have   \n         harvested the horseshoe crab for use as fishing bait. Since   \n         the 1970s, we have also used horseshoe crab blood for         \n         medical purposes. But we may have gone too far. Horseshoe     \n         crab numbers have declined significantly since the early      \n         1990s. And, naturally, so did their egg numbers. This         \n         is especially important to a small shorebird that is          \n         a global traveler of the most impressive kind. The red        \n         knot makes one of the longest migrations of any animal -      \n         a journey that takes it from one end of the earth to the      \n         other. To accomplish this feat, it relies on the eggs of      \n         the horseshoe crab. Without these eggs, the red knot is in    \n         danger. In the film Crash: A Tale of Two Species, filmmaker   \n         Allison Argo tells the story of nature's amazing ability      \n         to create fragile connections among the most unexpected       \n         creatures, and of our potential as humans to destroy those    \n          connections - or restore them.                                \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                          ORENJI, 2HD, DHD, CTU                        \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
