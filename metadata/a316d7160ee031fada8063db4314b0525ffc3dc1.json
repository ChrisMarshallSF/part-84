It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, Black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. The heyday of roots reggae is usually considered the latter half of the 1970s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with singers such as Johnny Clarke, Cornell Campbell, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Burning Spear, Max Romeo, Horace Andy, Hugh Mundell, and Lincoln Thompson, and groups like Black Uhuru, Steel Pulse, Israel Vibration, The Gladiators and Culture\n\n     The Abyssinians are a Jamaican roots reggae group, famous for their close harmonies and promotion of the Rastafari movement in their lyrics.

The group's second release, &quot;Declaration of Rights&quot;, featured Leroy Sibbles on backing vocals, and like their first was a huge hit in Jamaica and has been covered several times since. Their 1973 single &quot;Y Mas Gan&quot; was similar to &quot;Satta&quot; in its use of Amharic.   \n    Horace Andy is a roots reggae songwriter and singer, known for his distinctive vocals and hit songs such as &quot;Government Land&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Five Man Army&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Ain't No Sunshine&quot;.\n    Cornell Campbell aka Don Cornell or Don Gorgon is a reggae singer, best known for his trademark falsetto voice, and his recordings at Studio One in the late 1960s and his later work with Bunny Lee in the 1970s.        \n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a316d7160ee031fada8063db4314b0525ffc3dc1","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+291","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a316d7160ee031fada8063db4314b0525ffc3dc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,22,215,22,14,224,49,250,218,128,99,219,67,20,176,82,95,252,61,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
