The show continued the 1960s Beat-Club under a new name, and in turn was replaced by Extratour.\n\nA normal episode of Musikladen usually featured several live performances by guest musicians, and ran around 45 minutes. Some episodes were longer, and a few were shorter. In the 1980s, music videos were shown along with live performances.\n\n&quot;Voyeur&quot; is a 1982 single release from Kim Carnes's album Voyeur. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Voyeur&quot; and &quot;Does It Make You Remember&quot;, which peaked at #29 and #36 on Billboard magazine's pop singles chart, respectively. &quot;Say You Don't Know Me&quot; was released as a promo single in Canada, with no charting effect. In Continental Europe and Scandinavia &quot;Undertow&quot; was released as the follow-up to &quot;Voyeur&quot; and in the UK instead &quot;Take It on the Chin&quot;, both of which met with limited success.\n\nThis single reached #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts and #52 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. The song also achieved some international chart success too but failed to live up to record company expectations, particularly after the phenomenal success of &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; a year earlier.\n\nIn 1983, Carnes was nominated for a Best Pop Rock Performance (Female) Grammy Award for &quot;Voyeur&quot;.\n(video has a semi-transparent white logo at the top left)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeur_(Kim_Carnes_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeur_(Kim_Carnes_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikladen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikladen&lt;/a&gt; \n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/Fadphaadi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/Fadphaadi&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9585kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:18\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
