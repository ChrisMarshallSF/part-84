The hospital is in a deactivation process, with the patients being transferred to Saint James Hospital; however, due to a train crash, the closing process has been postponed. Amy is introduced to eight children with lung cases by the nurse Helen Perez, and she feels a sort of attraction for the terminal girl Maggie. Maggie likes to play with some letter blocks to talk with the mechanical girl called Charlotte that would live upstairs, in an abandoned floor. Amy asks about Charlotte to her coworkers and they explain that she is an urban legend and the Maggie is making up her existence. But sooner they find that the children can not be transferred to Saint James since there is something evil that wants to keep them near.\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\n\nRUNTIME.: 97 min\n\nSIZE.: DVD5\n\nVIDEO CODEC: x264, 2pass, L4.1\n\nFRAMERATE..: 25 fps\n\nBITRATE.: Variable 5655 Kbps\n\nRESOLUTION.: 1280552\n\nAUDIO 1.: English AC3 5.1 384 kbps\n\nAUDIO 2.: German AC3 5.1 384 kbps\n\nSUBTITLES..: None\n\nSOURCE..: HDTV 1080p H264\n\nIMDB RATING: 6.3/10 (2,661 votes)\n\nIMDB LINK..: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0422272/\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nIf any one has additional info or change in the description, please write it as a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa292df6ff8d8c12b00419e8445eba6bc5bc769a","amp;dn":"Fragile.2005.720p.HDTV.x264.CtrlHD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa292df6ff8d8c12b00419e8445eba6bc5bc769a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,41,45,246,255,141,140,18,176,4,25,232,68,94,186,107,197,188,118,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
