While this collection skews slightly more toward his compassionate side, our Southern California anti-hero (think of him as longtime champion Jackson Browne's troubled cousin) continues to explore twisted psyches with dark humor and rough poetry. Zevon produced this album and plays most of the instruments (guests include Bruce Hornsby and David Lindley), and the spare surroundings opted for here suit the songs just fine. Zevon has long since fallen from the commercial heights he seized briefly in the mid-'70s, but Mutineer shows he remains as iconoclastic and engrossing as ever.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nWarren Zevon - vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards, percussion\nPeter Asher - vocals on &quot;The Indifference of Heaven&quot;\nRosemary Butler - vocals\nJorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n - bass, vocals\nBruce Hornsby - accordion\nLarry Klein - bass\nDavid Lindley - fiddle, cittern\nMichael Wolff - keyboards on &quot;Similar to Rain&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Seminole Bingo&quot; (Carl Hiaasen, Warren Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n2.&quot;Something Bad Happened to a Clown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n3.&quot;Similar to Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n4.&quot;The Indifference of Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n5.&quot;Jesus Was a Cross Maker&quot; (Judee Sill) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n6.&quot;Poisonous Lookalike&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n7.&quot;Piano Fighter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n8.&quot;Rottweiler Blues&quot; (Hiaasen, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n9.&quot;Monkey Wash Donkey Rinse&quot; (Duncan Aldrich, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n10.&quot;Mutineer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352452e544f90e73227ce2406ec464417788eb45","amp;dn":"Warren+Zevon+-+Mutineer++%5B1995%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352452e544f90e73227ce2406ec464417788eb45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,36,82,229,68,249,14,115,34,124,226,64,110,196,100,65,119,136,235,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
