Eiliff was formed in the late 60s and although they hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t made a name for themselves even in the German underground scenary, they could be easily considered as one of the best German jazz-fusion bands from that time. Sadly they only put out two studio albums which were even made available in CD format, in despite of probably being out-of-catalog nowadays.\n\nFor our happiness, Garden of Delights released for the first time ever two live recordings from the band, as being one recorded in Cologne in 1972 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Close Encounters With Their Third OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and this one recorded in Bremen by Radio Bremen in the very same year. At that time Radio Bremen were recording many of those bands concerts to be broadcast as part of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Jazz ConcertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ programme. All of these highly-precious recordings are lying on Radio BremenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own vaults and Garden of Delights has been gradually making these recordings available for sale for the first time ever.\n\nEiliff set for this show is packed with uncountable solos and jammings in just two tracks, in which the last of them lasts over half an hour! But otherwise you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even realize the transition in between the tracks, so itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a freaking straight-forward sequence at once. And a great curiosity is that the guitarrist of this band, HouschÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ng NejadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©pour, had been member of Kraftwerk and after Eiliff end, he would become member of Guru Guru for a while. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef20b72a61a445cb0f862bc0d64dd23b0d0bcbc1","amp;dn":"Eiliff+-+Bremen+1972+%282003%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef20b72a61a445cb0f862bc0d64dd23b0d0bcbc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,32,183,42,97,164,69,203,15,134,43,192,214,77,210,59,13,11,203,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
