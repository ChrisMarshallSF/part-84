We are currently based in Johannesburg, South Africa. The band was formed in 2006 when Adam and Matt shared a vision for creating a metal band that would be different. This vision brought many challenges and successes in the years that followed, with each challenge bringing even greater success to the band.\n\nThis particular album is called the Time Machine, unfortunately I do not have the song titles. But the music itself is really good.\n\nRock on, and keep it metal \\m/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5b2f5a50eb457b1d1a3bc935401e7c608dc7c0","amp;dn":"Fragmented+Children+-+The+Time+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5b2f5a50eb457b1d1a3bc935401e7c608dc7c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,91,47,90,80,235,69,123,29,26,59,201,53,64,30,124,96,141,199,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
