It lets you play minecraft from a portable storage device and keeps your data and settings on the device.\n\nI have also included a highly compressed java portable from portableapps.com. The launcher will use that, unless you have jportable from portableapps.com installed alongside the minecraft portable directory.\n\nYou will need about 110mb free on your device to play Minecraft Portable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3699e186941ffe14305382130e4573a990364802","amp;dn":"Minecraft+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3699e186941ffe14305382130e4573a990364802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,153,225,134,148,31,254,20,48,83,130,19,14,69,115,169,144,54,72,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
