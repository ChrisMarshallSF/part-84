Friday Night Dinner is a truly\n                original series about the Goodmans, a family who have\n                made an art form of their eccentricities. In this\n                final episode, Adam comes home to find the house\n                looking immaculate, with classical music playing in\n                the living room, Mum's posh bowls on the dinner\n                table, Dad in a smart suit, and most mysteriously -\n                the table is set for five. The doorbell rings and in\n                comes Tanya Green, a girl Mum has been trying to fix\n                up with Adam for months. What follows is possibly the\n                most excruciating family dinner scene of all time.\n                Meanwhile, Jim has been locked out as his dog, Wilson\n                has swallowed his keys. And so the blind date\n                continues, but will Mum's dream of an Adam and Tanya\n                wedding come true?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49c8e0cb4caedfb82de2d3d674f1de98331b943","amp;dn":"Friday.Night.Dinner.S01E06.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49c8e0cb4caedfb82de2d3d674f1de98331b943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,156,142,12,180,202,237,251,130,222,45,61,103,79,29,233,131,49,185,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
