It was written by and starred John Candy and Eugene Levy, and directed by John Blanchard.\nThe Last Polka follows the life, careers, and the final concert of Yosh (Candy) and Stan (Levy) Shmenge, two brothers from the fictional country of Leutonia who become the biggest polka duo the world has ever seen. It is presented as a mixture of live concert performance and filmed scenes.\nOne stand out scene has The Shmenges performing an outdoor stadium Michael Jackson salute concert, complete with glitter outfits, sequin glove, and a polka version of &quot;Beat It&quot;.\nThe Shmenges were originally created as characters for the television series Second City TV and were also known on SCTV as The Happy Wanderers.\nMany fellow SCTV performers including Rick Moranis, Catherine O'Hara, and Robin Duke appear in the film. Dave Thomas narrates.\nThe Last Polka was produced for and first broadcast on the HBO cable network.
