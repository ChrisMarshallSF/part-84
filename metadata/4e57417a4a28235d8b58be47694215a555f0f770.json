The songs I heard were &quot;So Sweet&quot; and &quot;Catfish Blues&quot; and the music on that rare single release is now avalable here alongside a dozen have been issued previously!\n\nWhen I was in New York in the summer of 1969 the first artist I saw on stage was ... of course ... Larry Johnson. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e57417a4a28235d8b58be47694215a555f0f770","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Larry+Johnson+-++The+Country+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e57417a4a28235d8b58be47694215a555f0f770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,87,65,122,74,40,35,93,139,88,190,71,105,66,21,165,85,240,247,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
