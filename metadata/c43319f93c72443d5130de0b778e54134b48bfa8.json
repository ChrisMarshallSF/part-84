Vocalist Ross Bon, guitarist Gareth Best, saxophone players Jerry &quot;Big J&quot; DeVivo and Sam Burckhardt, bassist Jimmy Sutton, drummer Bob Carter, and pianist Donny Nichilo played local clubs for awhile, then gained a coveted residency at the Green Mill. After touring the Midwest and West Coast, Mighty Blue Kings were assured enough to begin recording. After forming their own R-Jay Records, the group released Meet Me in Uptown for an April 1996 release. Showcases at Austin's South by Southwest conference gained the band national attention, and upon signing to Sony's Work Records subsidiary they released their second album Come One, Come All in late 1997. A year later, the Mighty Blue Kings -- now consisting of Bon, Best, DeVivo, bassist Clark Sommers, saxophonist John Sandfort, and organist Chris Foreman -- returned with Live from Chicago. A seasonal effort, A Mighty Blue Christmas, was released in fall 2000.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tSwing\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tRJAY Records\n\n\nYet another band to emerge out of the '90s swing revival scene, but these guys came out before Brian Setzer hit it big, before the movie Swingers was ever scripted and before those Gap ads taught us how to &quot;Jump, Jive an' Wail.&quot; It's safe to say that Chicago's Mighty Blue Kings were ahead of their time before any trend bandwagon hit. And with their debut Meet Me in Uptown, these guys are playing smooth without any big-budget production or high energy. Instead, this record has more of a laid-back, bluesy feel with production that sounds as if it was recorded in the 1940s. But it's not like this album is undanceable -- it still swings hard. And with that, the Mighty Blue Kings prove that a modern-day swing band can capture the authenticity of how the music was meant to sound. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Jumpin' At The Green Mill\n02.Baby Drive Me Wild\n03.Grinnin' Like A Chessy Cat\n04.Loose Lips\n05.Cadillac Boogie\n06.Buzz Buzz Buzz\n07.Big Mamou\n08.Honey Chile Jump\n09.Spark Of My Life\n10.In The Night\n11.Meet Me In Uptown\n12.Rag Mop\n13.Pink Cadillac\n14.Tenor Madness\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43319f93c72443d5130de0b778e54134b48bfa8","amp;dn":"The+Mighty+Blue+Kings+-+Meet+Me+In+Uptown+%281996%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43319f93c72443d5130de0b778e54134b48bfa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,51,25,249,60,114,68,61,81,48,222,11,119,142,84,19,75,72,191,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
