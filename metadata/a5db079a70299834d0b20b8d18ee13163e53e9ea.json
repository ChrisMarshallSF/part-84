The Heatin' System compiles ten tracks from Argo/Cadet's mid-'60s zenith, and aficionados of acid jazz and funk will find much to savor here, highlighted by Jack McDuff's blistering title cut, the set also includes sublime entries from Baby Face Willette (&quot;Mo' Rock&quot;), Sahib Shihab (&quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot;) and Marlena Shaw (&quot;Liberation Conversation&quot;).\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nThe Heatin' System - Jack McDuff ( 12:23 )\n\nLiberation Conversation - Marlena Shaw ( 2:06 )\n\nScootin' - Sam Lazar ( 3:18 )\n\nSamba Blues - Frank Foster ( 6:30 ) \n\nPlease Don't Leave Me - Sahib Shihab ( 9:52 ) \n\nPassing Zone - Lou Donaldson ( 5:40 )\n\nBlue Bongo - Ramsey Lewis ( 4:20 ) \n\nFavourite Things - Red Holt ( 2:59 ) \n\nMo' Rock - Baby Face Willette ( 4:51 )\n\nAin't That Soul - Gene Shaw ( 5:17 )\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5db079a70299834d0b20b8d18ee13163e53e9ea","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+The+Heatin%5C%27+System+-+Essential+ArgoCadet+Groo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5db079a70299834d0b20b8d18ee13163e53e9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,219,7,154,112,41,152,52,208,178,11,141,24,238,19,22,62,83,233,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
