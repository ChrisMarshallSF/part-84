Good Points:\nThe band is scintilating! Ritchie tears it up!!! No doubt about it. Everyone else is so good. To me,\nthis is the best Video material of old Deep Purple excluding Smoke On The Water from the Machine Head DVD that was taken from\na 1973 TV special. When is the rest of that concert going to come out? Bad Points: Excluding Child in Time,\nall the songs were cut down in order to fit into a 30 minute TV program about Deep Purple.\nIt's just too bad that the rest of the songs weren't preserved for future release.\nThe German TV material is the Deep Purple Special Edition EP.\nThe 3 songs are No No No, Highway Star and Hallelujah. No No No is the best.\nSinging and playing are right on, with Ritchie wearing his Witches hat and looking like a possessed Warlock.\nHighway Star is pretty good, a song that hadn't been fully conceived yet. No Bach arpeggios from Ritchie here.\nHallelujah is lipsynced but is fantastic. The Ian Gillan Band material is much better than I thought it would be.\n\nContents:\n\nDeep Purple\n\n01.
