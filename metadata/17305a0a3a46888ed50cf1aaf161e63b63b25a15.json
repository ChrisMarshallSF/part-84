Features the twelve and a half minute misanthropic epic Ill At Ease, and fire and brimstone favorite Glory Amen.\n\nThose Poor Bastards play miserable and primitive old-time gothic country music. Lonesome Wyatt (guitar, vocals) and The Minister (banjo, bass, etc.) are both legally certified holiness preachers.\n\nIf you\\'re looking for slick, over-produced, commercial songs, you\\'d better cover your delicate little ears. Those Poor Bastards play it raw and they play it mean. Be a pal and support independent anti-corporate country music.\n\nThose Poor Bastards are the best Gothic Country I have heard yet to this day. The depressing gloomy vocals coming out of this drifter named Lonesome Wyatt has hints of Marilyn Manson to Nick Cave, Throwrag and maybe even a hint of a demented Adam Ant with a shot of a Pilled Up Johnny Cash... And the Minister is backing up Lonesome Wyatt with a style that is a cross between erie strung out folk music with a creepy blend of The Nightmare Before Christmas!!!!!!!!! \n\nÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥ Hank Williams III\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17305a0a3a46888ed50cf1aaf161e63b63b25a15","amp;dn":"Those_Poor_Bastards_Gospel_Haunted+mp3+%28working+torrent%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17305a0a3a46888ed50cf1aaf161e63b63b25a15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,48,90,10,58,70,136,142,213,12,241,170,241,97,230,59,99,178,90,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
