This makes for a heavier blues recording, co-produced by Brooks and Cheap Thrills album producer John Simon, who doubles on piano here (which he played on Janis Joplin's Turtle Blues on the aforementioned Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company disc). \n\nThe big revelations, though, are the cover songs, Dr. John's Qualified and an unbelievable version of Bobby Hebb's Sunny, which Buddy Miles just encompasses and devours. \n\nThe blending of styles is intuitive, as Hebb and Mac Rebennack/Dr. John had worked together on their own.\n \nVirgil Gonsalves' flute at the end of Sunny is frosting on the cake, but the key is that a song which was a smash on three formats -- R&amp;B, country, and pop charts, and captured the heart of jazz musicians from Ella Fitzgerald to Pat Martino, gets this total reinvention here. \n\nAs brilliant as Nick Gravenites is as a songwriter, it is Hebb's tune which is the centerpiece of this disc, that Sony would take it and Buddy Miles' Mystery for the CD release of the first album is the real mystery. \n\nAlto sax player Stemsy Hunter is wonderful on lead vocals for With Time There Is Change, written by co-producer/bassist Harvey Brooks and perhaps the most captivating original here. \n\nThey all trade lead vocalist duties, from Nick Gravenites on Nothing to Do to Herbie Rich on the Dr. John cover. \n\nIt's an amazingly dense set of recordings which, years later, form a remarkable thread of sounds by musicians who worked with Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the latter day Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company, and who were taking the original concept a step further into uncharted waters. \n\nWhere the Electric Prunes were a fun psychedelic moment, the neon signs superimposed over Buddy Miles' face didn't get the same immediate recognition. \n\nMany of the core players from both discs reunited in 1974 for the Atlantic records release The Band Kept Playing. Real textbook material here, highly enjoyable, and very important.\n \n~ Joe Viglione, All Music Guide  \n__________\n\nTracklist: \n\n1. Soul Searchin' (Buddy Miles)\n\n2. Sunny (Bobby Hebb)\n\n3.
