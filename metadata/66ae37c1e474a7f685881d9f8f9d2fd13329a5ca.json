The film traces the journey of OM Shashtri, an American citizen of Indian origin, who loses all his wealth overnight to the global recession &amp; has been asked to vacate his home by the bank unless he pays up $100,000 (mortgaged amount) within 30 days. Seeing no other option Om comes to India to sell a small piece of an ancestral property. But within days of landing in India he is kidnapped by a 'recession-hit' underworld gang those who think that he is still a millionaire. What happens to Om, is he able to save his home, how did the 'poor' gangster cope with their 'poor' catch &amp; what do small town Indian gangsters have to say to President Obama...is largely forms the rest of the story.
