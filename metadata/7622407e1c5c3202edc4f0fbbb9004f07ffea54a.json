Some Fiction, some not but Erie \n\nAve's music is all based upon the harsh realities of his life. A life which many people never have to see \n\ndue to the priveleged position they were born into and many others are just too afraid to see. Without a \n\nrecord deal how far can an artist from the street really get? That is the million dollar question facing \n\nErie Ave and the answer to that question will unfold along with Erie's rise from Hell Bottom. Welcome to \n\nthe legacy, the deception of an unsigned artist with caviar dreams.\n\nErie was born in a place that was so dangerous that, when there's trouble, the government can't really do \n\ntoo much about it. Street wars, poverty, crime in all it's forms and anything else that has to do with \n\nviolence, is the life in Africa. On September 14, 1988 a soulja named Malik (Erie Ave) was born in the \n\nheart of the gutters and ghettos in the Congo. His parents wanted he and his brothers to grow up in a safe \n\nand better environment so they moved to America when Erie was 4 or 5 and settled in Washington DC in an \n\narea where (as it turned out) it was very similar to the place they had come from. &quot;I remember practically \n\nlearning how to count by listening to the gunshots every night when we first got there&quot; says Erie.\n\n Years flew by and Erie started to adapt and became a problem child. Even though he grew up in a big family \n\nErie always felt lonely so he isolated himself and did whatever he wanted and didn't care about anything. \n\n&quot;I believe that feeling of loneliness came from not really getting along with my brothers and sisters, and \n\nmy parents or anyone else not understanding me&quot; says Erie. \n\nAs Erie grew up his parents moved frequently until they ended up in Maryland where, at the age of 11, Erie \n\nstarted running the streets, and started kicking it with two of his home boys Name Keino (Klutch) and Dialo \n\n(D). They formed a small click together and started rapping, never serious about it, so they just \n\nfreestyled all the time on the corner or anywhere they could. &quot;I never got the love at home that I felt as \n\nthough I needed, so I ran the streets, where I felt as though I was home&quot; says Erie.\n\nGrowing up in a broken home with a lot of financial problems lead Erie to become a hustla, making money by \n\nany means necessary and school was nowhere near his mind. He stared to live a dangerous life, but it didn't \n\nmatter too much to him. &quot;As long as I can survive&quot; was his motto. He was stabbed and shot at the age of 14 \n\nand faced many more potentially deadly situations while living the thug life. \n\nAs a result he has been to several juvenile facilities. The last one that he was in really got him thinking \n\nabout this rap game and his future. With that in his mind he started to get serious about writing lyrics \n\nday and night and got out and started revealing the talent that he possess on stage in local venues in the \n\ngreater Washington DC area. Now he is determined to show the world what he can do as a rapper and an \n\nentertainer.\n\nConnect with Erie Ave on these social networks and follow his rise to fame:\n\nTwitter:\n\nFacebook:\n\nYoutube:\n\nMyspace:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7622407e1c5c3202edc4f0fbbb9004f07ffea54a","amp;dn":"Erie+Ave%3A+%5C%22Back+On+MY+Grizzie%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7622407e1c5c3202edc4f0fbbb9004f07ffea54a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,34,64,126,28,92,50,2,237,196,240,251,187,144,4,240,127,254,165,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
