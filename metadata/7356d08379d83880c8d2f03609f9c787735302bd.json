It was taped for VH1 / MTV this is a great pro shot performance. Recorded on November 14th in Orlando, Florida. The classic hits from Bat 1 and Bat 2 are performed here and Meat Loaf is GREAT! It was aired on TV in two blocks. That's why you see credits running through Rock and Roll Dreams. I did my best to rearrange the videos into one concert. Changed the order as they were shown on TV to make the set closer to the rest of the concert tour and edited out all the commercial breaks.\n\nNTSC DVD\nRunning time: 76 minutes\nStereo sound\nChapters: Yes for each song\nCover: Created and included by me\n\n\nSET LIST:\n 01 Anything For Love\n02 You Took the Words\n03 Life is a Lemon\n04 Rock and Roll Dreams\n05 Two Out of Three\n07 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n08 Heaven Can Wait\n09 Objects in the Rearview Mirror\n10 Bat Out Of Hell\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7356d08379d83880c8d2f03609f9c787735302bd","amp;dn":"History+of+Meat+Loaf+Live+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7356d08379d83880c8d2f03609f9c787735302bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,86,208,131,121,216,56,128,200,210,240,54,9,249,199,135,115,83,2,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
