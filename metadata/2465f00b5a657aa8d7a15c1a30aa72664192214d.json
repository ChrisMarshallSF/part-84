A beleaguered church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights to transport an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight\\'s pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2465f00b5a657aa8d7a15c1a30aa72664192214d","amp;dn":"Season+Of+The+Witch+Cam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2465f00b5a657aa8d7a15c1a30aa72664192214d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,101,240,11,90,101,122,168,215,161,92,26,48,170,114,102,65,146,33,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
