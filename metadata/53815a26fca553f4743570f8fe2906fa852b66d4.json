Last Train to Clarksville\n\n128 kbps, MP3, LP rip\n\n\n\nShape Of Things To Come, In which George Benson stretches out over the pop grooves of 1968, pursued stage left by flutes, strings, harmonica, and studio brass orchestrations. Not to mention the sound of Benson himself holding forth on, according to the original liner notes, &quot;alto guitar with Varitone attachment--a wild, doubled sound.&quot;\n\nIf you want to hear the heir to Wes Montgomery swing hard over a standard, forget it--and you'll have to wait until the second-to-last cut to hear him get serious on a blues. Finally though, on &quot;Shape of Things That Are and Were,&quot; he does his thing with style and abandon. When the horns surface, they provide a kick reminiscent of Oliver Nelson's charts for Wes Montgomery and Jimmy Smith. It's worth the wait. Benson works up a serious head of steam on &quot;Don't Let Me Lose This Dream,&quot; employs lush chord-melody work on &quot;Face it Boy, It's Over,&quot; and gets plenty of room to stretch over a vamp during &quot;Last Train to Clarksville.&quot;\n\nAll tracks have been digitally remastered.\n\nRecorded at Van Gelder Studios, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.
