SFV and NFO must be included\n1.2) Rars must be in multiples of 50 MiB, no more than 99 files\n1.3) Compressed rars are not allowed\n1.4) Release must be muxed into a mkv container\n1.5) NFO should contain information on Audio and Video Bitrate\n1.6) BluRay and HDDVD sources dupe each other\n1.7) Suggested directory format:\nMovie.Name.YEAR.&lt;720p/1080p&gt;.BluRay.x264.&lt;PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK&gt;-GROUP\nTV.Show.SxxExx.&lt;720p/1080p&gt;.BluRay.x264.&lt;PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK&gt;-GROUP\n1.8) No intros, outros, betweenos, or any other form of defacement of the film will be tolerated\n1.9) Credits must not be removed but can be encoded at a lower bitrate provided they\ndon't contain any scenes (bloopers, story, etc)\n1.10) A sample roughly 60 seconds in length is required\n1.10.1) It must be cut from the final release and not encoded separately\n1.10.2) It must be put within a directory named &quot;Sample&quot; Video\n2.1) If needed, appropriate de-interlacing and ivtc must be applied\n2.2) Must use a minimum encode of 2 passes\n2.3) Width of release must be mod 16. Height of release must be mod 8\n2.4) Crop the black borders from the source. Crop to the widest frame possible\nInfo: For technical reasons you cannot crop 1 pixel, the minimum is 2 pixels, therefore propering for 1 pixel over/under does\nnot make sense\n2.4.1) Resizing is not allowed on 1080p encodes. Either crop to closest mod8/mod16 without overcropping, or crop().addborders()\n2.5) Use the same aspect ratio as the source, not what IMDB, cover or any other sources say\n2.6) Custom Matrices are allowed\n2.7) VfW (Video for Windows) is not allowed\n2.8) x264 version used must be no more than 50 revisions from newest\n2.9) Level 4.1 must be respected\n2.10) --deblock must be enabled (default)\naq-mode must be enabled (default)\nbframes 3 or higher is required (default)\nref 5 or higher is required unless the vertical resolution is greater than 864, then 4 must be used to respect L4.1\nme umh or higher is required\nsubme 7 or higher is required (default)\ntrellis 1 or higher is required (default)\n2.11) 720p refers to a MAXIMUM resolution of 1280x720\n2.11.1) For aspect ratio equal or above 1.78 horizontal resolution must be 1280\ne.g. AR of 2.35:1 will be 1280x544\n2.11.2) For aspect ratio lower than 1.78 vertical resolution must be 720\ne.g. AR of 1.33:1 will be 960x720\n2.12) 1080p refers to a MAXIMUM resolution of 1920x1080\n2.12.1) For aspect ratio equal or above 1.78 horizontal resolution must be 1920\ne.g. AR of 2.35:1 will be 1920x816\n2.12.2) For aspect ratio lower than 1.78 vertical resolution must be 1080\ne.g. AR of 1.33:1 will be 1440x1080\n2.13) Video bitrate should be as follows:\n2.13.1) 720p - Minimum 4000 kbit, maximum 8000 kbit.

Small portions containing store stickers/barcodes may be blurred or blackened\nIt's encouraged to also add a web hoster link to nfo to avoid trading skips\n8.1.2) Cover scans and m2ts samples may be added but DO NOT count as sufficient proof\n8.1.3) Releases that fail to pre with such proof are to be considered a nuke and can be propered. Proofixes later than 2 hours from pre\n(if a proper has not been pred during that time) will not be accepted\n8.2) IMPORTANT NOTE:\nSome mobile phone cameras (such as iPhone) add exif metadata to the pictures (gps location for example). It is ESSENTIAL to make\nsure exif metadata is removed from your snapshot.
