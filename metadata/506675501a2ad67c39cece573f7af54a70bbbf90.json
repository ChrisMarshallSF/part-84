A homeless man walks into the clinic and sits by another homeless man (Luke Goss) with a scar running down his chin. A nurse takes the latter man into a room with several people waiting where he is to be drained of blood, but kills his captors and reveals himself to be a new breed of vampire.Two years have passed since the climax of the first film, and Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been trying to find Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who survived his suicide attempt and turned into a vampire. He has been sweeping across Russia and eastern Europe, searching for his old friend and mentor, enlisting the aid of a young man, Scud (Norman Reedus), to design him a new line of gadgetry and weaponry. In the first scene, Blade fights his way through a large gang of vampires, leaving one of their number, Rush (Santiago Segura), alive, yet telling him he will be back for him. Blade finds Whistler locked in a tank of blood by a gang of vampires who were keeping him alive for purposes of torture. Blade rescues him and brings him to Prague.\n\n\n\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187738/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187738/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Fantasy | Horror\n\n\n\nComplete name: Blade 2\nEncoded by: Vice(HDScene-Release)\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1122.10 MiB\nDuration: 1h 56mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 343 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-26 08:49:43\n\n\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 2 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\n\nscreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21930553188051486737.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21930553188051486737.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56063562493136780604.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56063562493136780604.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStoryline: The film begins with an opening narration about Dracula, told by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds): In the movies, Dracula wears a cape and some old English guy always manages to save the day at the last minute with crosses and holy water, but everybody knows the movies are full of shit.\nThe truth is, it started with Blade and it ended with him.
