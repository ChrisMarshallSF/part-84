From 1950 till its\ndemise at the end of the 60s, Chess released a myriad of electric blues, rock 'n' roll\nand soul classics that helped change the landscape of black and white popular music.\n\nChess was the label that gave the world such sonic adventurers as Chuck Berry,\nMuddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Howlin' Wolf and Etta James. In this documentary to mark\nthe label's 60th anniversary, the likes of Jimmy Page, Mick Hucknall, Public Enemy's\nChuck D, Paul Jones and Little Steven, as well as those attached to the label such as\nfounder's son Marshall Chess, pay tribute to its extraordinary music and influence.\n\nThe film reveals how two Polish immigrants, Leonard and Phil Chess, forged\nfriendships with black musicians in late 1940s Chicago, shrewdly building a speciality\nblues label into a huge independent worth millions by the end of the 1960s. Full of\nvivid period detail, it places the Chess story within a wider social and historical\ncontext - as well as being about some of the greatest music ever recorded, it is,\ninevitably, about race in America during these tumultuous times.\n\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nCodec ID : mp42\nDuration : 59mn 24s\nOverall bit rate : 1399 Kbps\n\nVideo\nBit rate : 1203 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.161\n\nAudio\nFormat : AAC\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nLanguage : English\n\n\nWill add screenshots when the site I use is up and running again\nwhich shouldn't take too long hopefully..\n\nThere are screenshots in a folder for you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2741616e644c31538ba90969292f32a45d6e2c10","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Legends+-+Roll+over+Beethoven+-+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2741616e644c31538ba90969292f32a45d6e2c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,65,97,110,100,76,49,83,139,169,9,105,41,47,50,164,93,110,44,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
