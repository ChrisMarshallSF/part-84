There's a groove here that's undeniable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a sense of swing that grabs us right from the get-go, and makes us totally love each new track before Mann's flute even comes into the mix! These grooves come from some great interplay between Dave Pike on marimbas, Haygood Hardy on vibes, Billy Bean on guitar, and a host of hip percussionists who include Willie Bobo, Carmen Costa, and Carlos Patato Valdez! Tracks are long, with a Joao Donato-like sense of space ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ similar to Pike's excellent bossa work for Prestige around the same time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which makes a perfect settion for Herbie's soulful flute. The whole thing's wonderful, and titles include &quot;Me Faz Recordar&quot;, &quot;Minha Saudade&quot;, &quot;Copacabana&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, and &quot;BN Blues&quot;. Originally issued as Brazil, Bossa Nova, Blues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and issued here in the late 60s with a different cover! (Solid State pressing.)
