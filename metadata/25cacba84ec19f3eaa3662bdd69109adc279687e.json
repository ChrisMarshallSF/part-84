Arabs have taken to the streets demanding freedom. As the winds of change blew across the Arab world, the US, the power that has long dominated the region, has been particularly absent.\n\nWith all its allies crumbling one after another, what will the US do to maintain its influence in the region? And what can be expected of Israel, the country's closest ally in the region?\n\nWill the spread of democracy lead to a peaceful end to decades of autocratic rule in the Middle East or will the fear of Islamist extremism galvanize Washington's resolve to reinforce Pax Americana?\n\nOur guests today are: Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University; Seymour Hersh, a Pulitzer-winning author; and Thomas Pickering, the former US under secretary of state.\n\nOur interviewees are: Clovis Maksoud, the director of the Center for the Global South; and Rob Malley, the Middle East director of International Crisis Group.\n\nmore info:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/empire/2011/02/20112875931593543.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/empire/2011/02/20112875931593543.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=============================================================\n\nConverted To : MPEG4 Video, H264, AAC \nSize : 90MB\nDuration : 00:24:58 mins\nVideo : MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x360  25.00fps\nAudio : AAC 44100Hz stereo 96Kbps\n\nYou can also watch this program on Youtube here:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25cacba84ec19f3eaa3662bdd69109adc279687e","amp;dn":"Al+Jazeera+-+Empire%3A+Pax+Americana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25cacba84ec19f3eaa3662bdd69109adc279687e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,202,203,168,78,193,159,62,170,54,98,189,214,145,9,173,194,121,104,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
