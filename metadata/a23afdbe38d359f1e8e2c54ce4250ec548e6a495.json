These files may be lost by emptying the Recycle Bin\nor using other deletion actions that bypass the Recycle Bin\naltogether. Such actions include Windows Shift-Delete,\ncommand line deletion, deleting excessively large files or\nusing applications that delete files without the Recycle Bin.\nWhen a file is deleted from the Recycle Bin, or if the\nrecycle bin is bypassed altogether, the file can no longer be\nrecovered by the Windows Operating System. However, the\ncontent of the file still remains on the drive, relatively\nintact, until the section of the drive it occupies is\noverwritten by another file.\n\nFile Recover identifies the contents of these lost files on\nthe hard drive and allows you to recover them. If a file has\nbeen partially overwritten, File Recover attempts to\nreconstruct as much of the file as possible with the\nremaining contents. This allows you to salvage at least part,\nif not all, of that recovered file to continue using it as\nrequired.\n\nURL: http://www.pctools.com\n\niNSTALL NOTES\n\nInstall program, apply patch and use our keygen.\nEnjoy\n\nGROUP NOTES\n\nTeam BRD is not responsible for the bad usage of this product\nThis release is for EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY\nif you like it, u MUST buy it, Software Authors deserve support\n\nRemember, this is an INTERNAL SCENE RELEASE, we DONT support\nthe spread of this rls over web or p2p networks\n\nThe Black Riders Cult is looking for\n\n.
