Anim Mod will do exactly that by changing the transition animations for your whole device! Choose from several different animations to show off your \nalready customized phone. Every time you open a window, receive a popup dialog, press the menu button you will notice your custom animations. Bored of the same one? Anim Mod allows you to have different transition animations each reboot.\n\n* Required Root Access *\n\nAnimations include:\n\nStock Android\nBounce\nBlur Animations\nDrop In\nFlip\nFly in &amp; Flip\nFly In\nFold\n\nTo view some of the animations included in the app see these videos:\n\n\nAnim Mod changes the system framework files without touching your theme so if you constantly switch from ROM to ROM you can always get the animation you prefer the best.\n\nBefore changing animations you should make sure that you are rooted. Anim Mod also needs busybox but if you don't have it Anim Mod will install it for you.\n\nWhat's in this version:\n\n* Option to have random animations (enable in settings)\n* Progress bar for animation downloads\n* Added check/install for busybox\n* Fixed bugs with some ROMs/devices not applying animations Some still may not     work. Please send a logcat with device and \n  ROM name for possible future support CyanogenMod 7. seems to work on all devices I tested\n* Redid a lot of code for performance\n* Small UI enhancements\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6e5110c94c9925778e0ea1855c36fdd3ab578a","amp;dn":"Anim+Mod+Version.+1.1+For+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d6e5110c94c9925778e0ea1855c36fdd3ab578a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,110,81,16,201,76,153,37,119,142,14,161,133,92,54,253,211,171,87,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
