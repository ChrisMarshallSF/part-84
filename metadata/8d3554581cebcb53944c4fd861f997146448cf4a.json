He says, &quot;When we were \n\t\twatching the Twitter feed my wife said 'We need to \n\t\tdo something' and what we are good at is doing shows. \n\t\tSo we decided to try and get together the biggest \n\t\tshow possible and raise as much money as we could \n\t\tto help out.&quot;\n\t\t\n\t\tAnd the response to his plea was more the Wills \n\t\tcould have ever expected: &quot;Everybody was very keen \n\t\tto be a part of the show. In fact we could have \n\t\tfilled the line-up three times over with the amount \n\t\tof support we were given.&quot;\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRippers Notes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tOur thoughts go out to the families of the \n\t\tdead/missing people in Christchurch earthquake 22nd Feb 2011\n\t\tFrom all encoders Team FiH and FiHTV\n\n\t\tPlease Donate here http://www.redcross.org.nz/donate\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tContact: \n\t\t\t   if you got what it takes to be a LEGEND!\n\t\t\t   NZ/AU/US/UK Cappers wanted","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3554581cebcb53944c4fd861f997146448cf4a","amp;dn":"Stand.Up.For.Christchurch.PDTV.XviD-FiHTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3554581cebcb53944c4fd861f997146448cf4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,53,84,88,28,235,203,83,148,76,79,216,97,249,151,20,100,72,207,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
