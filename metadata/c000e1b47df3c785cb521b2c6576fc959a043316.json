While hunting, they discover an iceberg that shoots a beam of light into the sky. Inside of the iceberg is a boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) and a flying bison named Appa. Unknown to them, Aang is the long lost Avatar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the only person on the planet able to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ all four elements. One hundred years have passed since the Fire Nation has declared war on the other three nations of Air, Water and Earth in their attempt to conquer the world. Zuko (Dev Patel), an exiled prince of the Fire Nation, is on a quest to find the Avatar and bring him as prisoner to his father, Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis). Seeing the light that appeared from Aang's release, Zuko and some Fire Nation soldiers arrive at the Southern Water Tribe to demand the villagers hand over the Avatar. Aang reveals himself as he surrenders himself to Zuko on the condition that he agrees to leave the village alone. On the ship, Aang is tested by Zuko's Uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub) to confirm him to be the Avatar. After being informed that he is to be their prisoner for passing the test, Aang escapes using his glider and flies to his flying bison brought by Katara and Sokka. Aang and his new friends visit the Southern Air Temple and he learns that he was in the ice for a whole century and that the Fire Nation wiped out all Air Nomads, including his guardian, Monk Gyatso. In despair, he enters the Avatar state and finds himself in the spirit world where he encounters a dragon spirit that tells him to make his way to the Northern Water Tribe to master Water Bending.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Family\n\nRelease date: 13 August 2010 (UK)\n\nNoah Ringer\nNicola Peltz\nJackson Rathbone\nDev Patel\nShaun Toub\nAasif Mandvi\nCliff Curtis\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: the last airbender 2010\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1623.46 MiB\nDuration: 1h 43mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 199 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\ntrackers\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash: C000E1B47DF3C785CB521B2C6576FC959A043316\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13845959979856275887.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13845959979856275887.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/67146981774277926674.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/67146981774277926674.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/59716339111543338326.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/59716339111543338326.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/75768834666739096379.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/75768834666739096379.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/15261936825902983848.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/15261936825902983848.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollow HDScene Release Group on Facebook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c000e1b47df3c785cb521b2c6576fc959a043316","amp;dn":"The+Last+Airbender+2010+BRrip+720p+x264+acc+vice+%28HDScene+Releas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c000e1b47df3c785cb521b2c6576fc959a043316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,0,225,180,125,243,199,133,203,82,27,44,101,118,252,149,154,4,51,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
