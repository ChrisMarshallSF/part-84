(sounds like heaven, right?)\n\nunder normal circumstances, i play guitar in a band called incubus. but last year i was forced to stop playing for several months due to a wrist injury that required surgery, as well as a time-intensive recovery. without the option of picking up a guitar, it was during that idle time that i began to write music for the orchestra, which became like a musical game of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tetrisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for me. a huge challenge on both cerebral and intellectual levels. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s any good, either.\n\nrather than record this music and release it as an album, i thought it would be much more risky and fun to for the maiden voyage of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“end.&gt;vacuumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to happen as a live, unedited performance in front of my family, friends, and fans. with all mishaps intact.\n\nthe music will be performed in nine movements, by a group of musicians i am calling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the graviton modern ensembleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“. it will be a mixture of professional philharmonic players and friends. throughout the piece, i will play a variety of different instruments (sans guitar) alongside my brother, benjamin einziger, and my good friend blake mills. suzie katayama will be conducting.\n\nto make this event even more heavenly, the first part of the program will consist of a lecture by my friend and esteemed british physicist, dr. brian cox. he is a world-renowned scientist who acts as a science correspondent for the BBC, and is currently conducting monumental research at the large hadron collider at CERN. the large hadron collider is a particle accelerator, and is the most powerful/ complex/expensive machine ever built by humans (google it). his talk will be a discussion on particle-physics and the mind-bending potential for major discoveries at CERN in the near future.\n\nall this could make for an amazing evening at UCLA, or it could be a train-wreck. weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll all decide that together.&quot;\n\n-Mike Einziger, 7/1/08\n\n\n\nThanks to Sabina3401 for uploading the original bootleg!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977e9d2e90ed7e9daf2f3a4fa51e35b977096aa5","amp;dn":"Mike+Einziger+-+End.%3Evacuum+++%5Bbootleg%2C+8%2F23%2F08+at+Royce+Hall%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977e9d2e90ed7e9daf2f3a4fa51e35b977096aa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,126,157,46,144,237,126,157,175,47,58,79,165,30,53,185,119,9,106,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
