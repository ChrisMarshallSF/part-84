In September 1999, Snoop Dogg stated that he, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Xzibit, Warren G and Nate Dogg would form the line-up. By April 2000, Ice Cube was on board as part of the tour, which was slated for a June 15 start in San Diego. MC Ren, original member of N.W.A, was expected to join the tour in order to have reunited version of N.W.A along with Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. Come May the tour was officially known as the Up In Smoke Tour, and Dr. Dre was promising fans &quot;It's gonna be incredible. We're gonna give everybody that's been buying our records a real show, something they've never seen before.&quot;\n\nBy June, the month which the tour began in, plans were finalized with Kurupt joining the tour. It was decided that he would start the opening set which would be followed by Warren G and Xzibit, then Ice Cube would take the third spot whilst Eminem would take the fourth set. Dr. Dre would be the final set with collaborations including Snoop Dogg and the N.W.A reunion taking place during this segment. Also, surprise guests were promised during various shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:785f4951ab08f9a3076d3cfabb95d3d5ac6aa028","amp;dn":"The+Up+In+Smoke+Tour+%282000%29+-+Eminem+-+Ice+Cube+-++Dr.+Dre+-+Sno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"785f4951ab08f9a3076d3cfabb95d3d5ac6aa028","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,95,73,81,171,8,249,163,7,109,60,250,187,149,211,213,172,106,160,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
