Comcast merged with NBC in January, and last month AT&amp;T announced plans to purchase T-Mobile, a deal that could leave the country with just three wireless carriers. Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission faces increasing criticism for its lack of progress on expanding the nation's broadband system. We host a media roundtable with Craig Aaron, incoming president of media advocacy group Free Press; Sascha Meinrath, director of the New America Foundation's Open Technology Initiative; and Malkia Cyril, the executive director and founder of the Center for Media Justice.\n\n\n- The Fall of Glenn Beck: Did the Controversial Fox Host Become an Economic Liability?\n\nFox News host Glenn Beck announced Wednesday in a carefully worded press release he will &quot;transition off of his daily program&quot; later this year in order to pursue solo projects. Fox News Chair Roger Ailes denied economic pressure played a role in Fox's decision to let Beck go. But major advertisers have stayed away from Beck's show since 2009, when he claimed President Obama has &quot;a deep-seated hatred of white people, or the white culture.&quot; We speak with James Rucker, co-founder of ColorOfChange.org, a group whose economic boycott of Beck prompted as many as 300 companies to abandon the right-wing pundit's program.\n\n\n- Government Shutdown Looms Even as &quot;Government's Got Plenty of Money to Keep Going&quot;\n\nNegotiations continue between Democrats and Republicans to break a U.S. budget deadlock and avoid a government shutdown. Without an agreement on spending for the next six months, money to operate the government runs out at midnight tonight. We discuss the possible shutdown and the latest news from Wisconsin with John Nichols, Washington correspondent for the The Nation magazine and associate editor of The Capital Times in Madison. He is also co-founder of the media advocacy group Free Press, the organization behind the National Conference for Media Reform. &quot;This is not a fight about money, it is not a fight about budgets. This is a fight about a gaming of the budget process. We have a group of Republicans who are saying the most critical overspending in the United States, the biggest budget that just has to be addressed, is that of Planned Parenthood,&quot; says Nichols.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f812e8b1c111522074d0c3c315187e659fa7ad","amp;dn":"+Democracy+Now+-+08+apr+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f812e8b1c111522074d0c3c315187e659fa7ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,248,18,232,177,193,17,82,32,116,208,195,195,21,24,126,101,159,167,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
