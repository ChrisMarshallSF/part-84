Many applications provide safe storage areas for your private web information, but you often need to add your data by hand, then manually copy it back out when the time calls. We knew there had to be a better way.\n\nTrue Integration With Web Browsers\n\n1Password offers what no one else does: true web browser integration. Many applications provide safe storage areas for your private web information, but you often need to add your data by hand, then manually copy it back out when the time calls. We knew there had to be a better way.\n\n Support for Popular Web Browsers\n\nThe password, identity, and personal information tools that come pre-bundled with web browsers are specific to their exclusive playgrounds. Your data is locked up in each browser, forcing you to find a way to migrate your passwordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even possibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½every time you switch browsers. With 1Password, your information travels with you.\n\nStrong Password Generator\n\nLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face it: the days of using your petÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name or your anniversary as a password are long gone. While 1Password remembers all your passwords so you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to, it also has a great tool called the Strong Password Generator for creating really strong, un-guessable passwords to keep you safe online.\n\nRock Solid Security\n\nAll of your confidential information is encrypted using AES, the same state-of-the-art encryption algorithm used as the national standard in the United States (Fun fact: AES stands for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAdvanced Encryption StandardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). 1Password uses 128-bit keys for encryption, which means it would take millions of years for a criminal to decrypt your data using a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbrute forceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ attack.\n\nSecurely Organize Your Life With Wallet\n\nThe Wallet provides a secure place to store sensitive information like credit cards, bank accounts, memberships and reward programs, etc. You can use 1PasswordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powerful encryption technology to safely save all this information and find it when you need it.\n\nAutomatically Fill Credit Cards While Shopping Online\n\nShop more conveniently and keep your credit card numbers out of business hands by saving them locally in 1PasswordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wallet, then filling them into shopping forms when you want.\n\nAutomatically Fill Addresses, Contact Information, Forums, and More\n\nIn addition to credit card numbers, 1Password allows you to automatically fill even more things like your address, contact information, favorite links, and forum registrations with just a single click. You can save all or some of this information in a 1Password Identity, and you can create as many Identities as you like.\n\nWhats new:\n\nNew Setup Screens\n\n* Improved Welcome screens to help new and existing users  setup\n  1Password.\n* New introduction screens for categories with no items, as well a\n  ability to import sample data to quickly see how 1Password works.\n\nMain Window\n\n* New Activity view to display and manage background tasks.\n\n* Improved search in Snow Leopard, the found items can now be selected\n   immediately using Up and Down arrow keys, without the need to leave\n   the search field.\n\n* 2 new window layouts: Widescreen and Shelves.\n\nList View\n\n* Ability to customize which columns are shown in list views for each\n    category\n\n* Navigate between items using three-finger multi-touch swiping.\n\n* New icons for wallet items and accounts.\n\n* Category item counts can now be shown or hidden.\n\n* Keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation between the categories and \n   changing layout mode.\n\n* Improved password strength indicators to better display very low\n   strength passwords.\n\nDetail View\n\n* Configure iPhone security levels directly on your Mac.\n\n* Dynamically resizing single-line and multi-line edit fields.\n\n* Spell checking in Secure Notes\n\n* Search text inside Secure Notes as well as auto-scrolling to found text\n   when using the find panel.\n\n* Ability to add and remove fields from Logins.\n\n* Easy way to configure Login username and password.\n\n* Better date field entry using popup calendar.\n\n* Improved copy-to-clipboard for the credit card numbers to not include\n   spaces or dashes.\n\n* Passwords can be hidden even in edit mode to protect your privacy.\n\n* Hidden passwords can be quickly revealed by holding the Option key.\n\n* Can now quickly generate passwords for Wallet Items and Accounts.\n\n* New hover graphics for one-click copy of usernames, passwords, and \n  all other fields for easy pasting into other applications.\n\nBrowser Extensions\n* Browser toolbar buttons are now completely customizable using the \n   new ~/Library/Application Support/1Password/Custom/ToolbarButtons\n   folder.\n* Added Help &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Reset Folder Permissions to fix \n   majority of the configuration problems.\n\n* Improved Go&amp;Fill window in the browser.
