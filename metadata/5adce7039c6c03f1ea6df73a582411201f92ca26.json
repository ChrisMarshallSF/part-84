Their long-running partnership seems to come to an abrupt end when Marty is killed by a hit-and-run, but Marty is soon back--as a ghost--to help solve his own murder. While he's doing it, he misses his chance to go to heaven, thanks to an ancient curse that states: &quot;Before the sun shall rise, each ghost unto his grave must go. Cursed be the ghost who dares to stay and face the awful light of day.&quot; So Marty is stuck on Earth, as a white-suited spirit whom only Jeff can see, continuing their partnership and keeping (jealous) tabs on his wife/widow, Jean.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5adce7039c6c03f1ea6df73a582411201f92ca26","amp;dn":"Randall+%26+Hopkplete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5adce7039c6c03f1ea6df73a582411201f92ca26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,220,231,3,156,108,3,241,234,109,247,58,88,36,17,32,31,146,202,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
