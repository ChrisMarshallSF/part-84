Muhammed - Bir Peygamberin MirasÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â±&quot;\n\n&quot;Muhammed: Legacy of a Prophet&quot; with Turkish Subtitles\n\nTells the story of the seventh century prophet who changed world history in 23 years, and continues to shapes the lives of more than 1.2 billion people. The film takes viewers not only to ancient Middle Eastern sites where Muhammed's story unfolds, but into the homes, mosques and workplaces of some of America's estimated seven million Muslim to discover the many ways in which they follow Muhammed's example. \n\nWritten by Unity Production Foundation (M.
