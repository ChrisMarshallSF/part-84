At their wits' end dealing with issues such as teen drinking, drug use, reckless driving and disrespecting authority, these parents accepted Dr. PhilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s offer to send their girls to a residential program in Utah for out-of-control teens. When Kimberly and David returned to report the remarkable progress their girls were making, Dr. Phil didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mince words about the mistakes the couple continued to make. Now, the parents return again. Find out what happened after the girls finished their program in Utah, why Kimberly and David are in conflict about the next step, and how a near-death experience could be affecting this familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decisions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c616c99775449ecbb4077e17bd8420f8f6befa8b","amp;dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2011.03.29.Troubled.Teens.Crisis.Point.HDTV.x264-NB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c616c99775449ecbb4077e17bd8420f8f6befa8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,22,201,151,117,68,158,203,180,7,126,23,189,132,32,248,246,190,250,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
