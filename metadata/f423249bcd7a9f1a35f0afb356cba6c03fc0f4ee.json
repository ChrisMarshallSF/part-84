This time he is sent to St. Mary's, a run-down parochial school on the verge of condemnation. He and Sister Benedict work together in an attempt to save the school, though their differing methods often lead to good-natured disagreements.&quot; (Helton)\n\n\nDuration: 2:05:56\n\n112 kbps mpa\n1201 kbps DivX\n640 x 480\n\n\nThis DivX movie plays fine in Media Player Classic and VLC player. I couldn't get decent fidelity when I originally ripped it for 700MB file size, so I'm sorry that it is just over a gigabyte, but The quality is almost verbatim this way.  Please seed, comment, leave tips and tricks for ripping new DVDs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f423249bcd7a9f1a35f0afb356cba6c03fc0f4ee","amp;dn":"The+Bells+of+Saint+Marys+%281945%29.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f423249bcd7a9f1a35f0afb356cba6c03fc0f4ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,35,36,155,205,122,159,26,53,240,175,179,86,203,166,192,63,192,244,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
