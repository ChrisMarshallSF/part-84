The controversial plot line explores issues such as dysfunctional families, mental illness (including eating disorders), sexual orientation identity, substance abuse and death. The show was created by father and son television writers Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain for Company Pictures, and premiered on E4 on 25 January 2007.\n\nSkins has broadcast five seasons, and has been commissioned up to a sixth. In the UK, the show is currently on its fifth series, which introduces a third generation of Bristolian teenagers. A Skins film, focusing on characters from the show's first four series, is also in production. The Skins brand has also been exported overseas; an American adaptation began airing on MTV in 2011, where it has been subject to significantly more controversy than the UK original despite the show becoming less racy due to American FCC regulations.\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nSEASON THREE DESCRIPTION:\n\nWe are introduced to the new cast on their first day at Roundview College in the series premiere, &quot;Everyone&quot;. JJ Jones, James Cook and Freddie McClair are best friends to begin with; twins Katie and Emily Fitch know Naomi Campbell from school but are distant with her because Katie is homophobic and suspects her of being a lesbian. The gang meet Effy, and sidekick Pandora; Katie wants to become Effy's best friend, and both Cook and Freddie are instantly smitten. Cook passes the test set by Effy and begins a casual sex relationship with her. Episode two focuses on Cook who invites the whole group over, but their friendships are not very strong yet; chaos ensues, and Cook angers local gangster Johnny White (Mackenzie Crook). Thomas Tomone is only introduced in the third episode. He is a immigrant from the Congo, and develops a crush on Pandora. He endears himself to the group when he is able to get Johnny White off their backs by besting him in a pepper-eating competition. However, despairing at his decadent life in Bristol, Mrs Tomone brings Thomas back to the Congo. In &quot;Pandora&quot;, Pandora's innocent slumber party becomes an MDMA-fuelled rave after Katie spikes the brownies. Emily and Naomi kiss; Naomi denies being gay, but urges Emily to admit that she is, who also denies it. Pandora allows Cook to take her virginity, but regrets it when later Thomas returns from Congo.\n\nFreddie's episode shows his difficult relationship with his widower father (Simon Day) and his sister Karen (Klariza Clayton), who has ambitions to be a celebrity. His father converts Freddie's shedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½his personal sanctuaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½into a dance studio for Karen. He witnesses Effy's parents' breakup, discovers that Cook slept with his sister, gets punched in the face by his father, and when he goes to tell Effy how he feels about her discovers she is with Cook. In &quot;Naomi&quot;, Naomi runs against Cook for student president on the basis that if he wins she will have to sleep with him; when he wins however, he does not force her to take it further than kissing. She and Emily begin a sexual relationship, but Naomi is unwilling to accept the reality of its romantic nature. In &quot;JJ&quot;, Freddie and Cook's feud over Effy negatively affects JJ. At Emily's encouragement, he manages to confront them both about it, and later loses his virginity when Emily decides to have pity sex with him. Thomas discovers that Pandora has been cheating on him, and while high on JJ's medication, Cook reveals to Freddie that Effy loves Freddie and not him. In Effy's episode, she has nothing: her Queen Bee status has been usurped by Katie, sex with Cook means nothing, and her home life is a wreck. She finally feels something when she has sex with Freddie, but after being tormented by Katie, an intoxicated Effy hits her with a rock. Katie is recovering in &quot;Katie and Emily&quot; but her relationship with her sister is falling apart. However, at the college ball, Emily is able to assert herself and Naomi confesses she loves Emily back. Thomas and Pandora also reunite. The finale, also an &quot;Everyone&quot; episode, sees Cook and Effy hiding out with Cook's father (Matt King). JJ tracks them down however, and forces Effy to confess it is Freddie that she loves, but Cook is adamant he loves her too. Freddie closes the series, asking &quot;What do we do now?&quot;.\n\n###################################################################################\n\nINFORMATION - *ALL EPISODES ARE THE SAME!!*\n\n*General*\nFormat                           : MPEG-PS\nFile size                        : 1 024 MiB\nDuration                         : 25mn 59s\nOverall bit rate                 : 5 509 Kbps\n\n*Video*\nID                               : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat                           : MPEG Video\nFormat version                   : Version 2\nFormat profile                   : Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nFormat settings, GOP             : M=2, N=12\nDuration                         : 25mn 59s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 5 176 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 9 800 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Interlaced\nScan order                       : Top Field First\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.499\nStream size                      : 962 MiB (94%)\n\n*Audio*\nID                               : 128 (0x80)\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nDuration                         : 25mn 59s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 41.6 MiB (4%)\n\n###################################################################################\n\nNOTES:\n\nTHIS IS A DIRECT RIP OFF MY VERY OWN RETAIL DISC, AND HAS IN NO WAY BEEN EDITED, ENCODED, CONVERTED, RENAMED OR MANIPULATED IN ANYWAY!\n\nTHIS UPLOAD - \n* REGION FREE (NOT LOCKED)\n* INCLUDES ALL MENUS\n* HAS NO SUBTITLES (RETAIL DISC HAS NONE)\n* IS IN ENGLISH AND IS FULLY SPOKEN IN ENGLISH\n* HAS NO VIRUS, TROJAN, SPYWARE OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF MALICIOUS CONTENTS (AND IF ANYONE SAYS IT DOES THAN YOU ARE A COMPLETE FUCKHEAD!)\n\nThank you and please enjoy... remember to buy it if you like it!\n\n###################################################################################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b4535740b2e6787fe7c88b73ff1c3ab85a0229","amp;dn":"Skins+%28UK%29+-+Season+3+-+Disc+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b4535740b2e6787fe7c88b73ff1c3ab85a0229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,180,83,87,64,178,230,120,127,231,200,139,115,255,28,58,184,90,2,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
