The story follows space pirate Grayson Hunt, voiced by Steve Blum, and his cyborg partner Ishi Sato, who were both dishonorably discharged from Dead Echo after they were betrayed by their commanding officer, General Sarrano. 10 years later, after a spontaneous and liquor-induced attempt to take revenge on the General and his forces, Hunt's and Sato's ship crash-landed on the planet Stygia, a former resort planet now overrun with meat-eating plants, feral mutant tribes, criminals, and Godzilla-sized monsters. Hunt and Sato search for a way off the planet, all while doing battle with the General's forces, who also crashed on Stygia after Hunt's attack. Along the way, they're joined by Trishka Novak, a foul-mouthed woman with a dark past who also knows her way around a gun. One of the locations they travel to on Stygia is the city of Elysium, formerly a Vegas-like adult paradise.\n\n\nenjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d59c81be0b1a00acc002723605de3412dfc4d7b","amp;dn":"BULLETSTORM+PORTABLE+-+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d59c81be0b1a00acc002723605de3412dfc4d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,89,200,27,224,177,160,10,204,0,39,35,96,93,227,65,45,252,77,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
