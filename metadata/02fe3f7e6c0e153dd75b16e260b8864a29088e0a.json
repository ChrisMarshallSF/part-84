It focuses on a pair of teenage lovers who are on the run from their oppressive middle aged parents. This is a truly tragic film that certainly deserves acclaim separate from the usual light hearted, mildly entertaining selection of teen films that seem to rule young peoples cinema.\n\nThe realisation of the power of drugs hits you like a punch in the face. The tale is long, winding and powerful. Many have vowed to never pick up a needle such is the power of the writers intense portrayal of life on the streets and heroin users.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02fe3f7e6c0e153dd75b16e260b8864a29088e0a","amp;dn":"Junk+-+Melvin+Burgess+-+1%2B2%2B3+of+3+-+1999+-+%5B+TVRip+%28AVI%29+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02fe3f7e6c0e153dd75b16e260b8864a29088e0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,254,63,126,108,14,21,61,215,91,22,226,96,184,134,74,41,8,142,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
