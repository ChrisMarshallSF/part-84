He controlled a battle-hardened army, a tough police force, and most news media. But he underestimated his opponents, led by a student movement called Otpor! (Serbian for &quot;resistance&quot;), who attacked the regime with ridicule, rock music, and a willingness to be arrested. Their courage and audacity inspired others to overcome their fear and join the fight.\n\nOtpor! students were the shock troops in what became an army of human rights and pro-democracy activists who systematically undermined police and army loyalty to Milosevic and forced him to call early elections. When Milosevic refused to accept his defeat at the polls, the people responded with a general strike. As normal life ground to a halt, Serbs by the hundreds of thousands descended on the capital on October 5 to seize the parliament in a dramatic triumph for democracy. Milosevic was arrested and extradited to the Hague to stand trial for crimes against humanity in June 2001.\n\nRuntime: 56 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12c8bae1a8283b6ae875d2a34dc829ecba362306","amp;dn":"Bringing_Down_A_Dictator_Nonviolent_Resistance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12c8bae1a8283b6ae875d2a34dc829ecba362306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,200,186,225,168,40,59,106,232,117,210,163,77,200,41,236,186,54,35,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
