Sonically, it is sublime; the subtleties of a live performance are all left in. The interplay between guitarists Fred Tackett and Paul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©re is exceptional, as are the drop-dead-on-a-dime fills of keyboardist Bill Payne. The track selection leans a little more to the classic side of Little Feat's vast catalog, with many tracks from the 1970s in the set, including &quot;Time Loves a Hero,&quot; &quot;Skin It Back,&quot; &quot;Old Folks Boogie,&quot; &quot;Oh Atlanta,&quot; &quot;Spanish Moon,&quot; &quot;Dixie Chicken,&quot; &quot;Tripe Face Boogie,&quot; &quot;Fat Man in the Bathtub,&quot; &quot;Willin',&quot; and &quot;Feats Don't Fail Me Now.&quot; The latter material is served well, too, particularly &quot;I'd Be Lyin',&quot; by new lead vocalist (though she has been with the band for a decade) Shaun Murphy, and Bill Payne's &quot;Cadillac Hotel.&quot; And while it's fair to say that this is the band's best live outing since Waiting for Columbus, it in no way gets to the emotional and performance heights that classic slab did, even if the band does play &quot;better&quot; now. This set will not likely win the band any new fans, but if you're one of those who stuck it out after the passing of Lowell George, this collection might just be the thing you're looking for. \n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bill Payne - vocals, keyboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Paul Barrere - vocals, guitar, slide guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Shaun Murphy - vocals, tambourine\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fred Tackett - guitar, mandolin, trumpet, vocals\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Kenny Gradney - bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Richie Hayward - drums, vocals\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sam Clayton - congas, vocals, percussion\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1. &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot; (Paul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, Kenny Gradney, Bill Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58\n2. &quot;Day or Night&quot; (Payne, Fran Tate) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:47\n3. &quot;Cadillac Hotel&quot; (Payne, Bill Wray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:46\n4. &quot;Spanish Moon&quot; (Lowell George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:25\n5. &quot;Skin It Back&quot; (BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:40\n6. &quot;Cajun Girl&quot; (Kibbee, Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:42\n7. &quot;Night on the Town&quot; (BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, Fred Tackett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:59\n8. &quot;I'd Be Lyin'&quot; (Creamer, Mariani, Shaun Murphy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n9. &quot;The Blues Don't Tell It All&quot; (Murphy, Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:20\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n1. &quot;Old Folks Boogie&quot; (BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:18\n2. &quot;Oh Atlanta&quot; (Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n3. &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; (George, Martin Kibbee) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 17:44\n4. &quot;Tripe Face Boogie&quot; (Richie Hayward, Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:18\n5. &quot;Fat Man in the Bathtub&quot; (George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:44\n6. &quot;Let It Roll&quot; (BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, Kibbee, Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:29\n7. &quot;Willin'&quot; (George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:06\n8. &quot;Feats Don't Fail Me Now&quot; (BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, George, Kibbee) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:23\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a80100d48e350ce712f93ac58dfb67cc1cfa3ee0","amp;dn":"Little+Feat+-+Highwire+Act+Live+In+St.+Louis+2003++%5B2004%5D++%5BRobb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a80100d48e350ce712f93ac58dfb67cc1cfa3ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,1,0,212,142,53,12,231,18,249,58,197,141,251,103,204,28,250,62,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
