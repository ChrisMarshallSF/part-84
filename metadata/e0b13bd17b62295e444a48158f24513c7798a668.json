Released in 1976, it was his first solo album and the most successful of Yes' solo efforts, reaching #8 in the UK charts and breaking into the US Top 50.[2]\n\nThe album tells the story of an alien race and their journey to a new world (the story printed in the LP jacket calls it &quot;the earth&quot;, lowercase 'e') due to catastrophe. Olias, the title character, is the chosen architect of the glider Moorglade, which will be used to fly his people to their new home. Ranyart is the navigator for the glider, and Qoquaq is the leader who unites the four tribes of Sunhillow to partake in the exodus.\n\n    Ocean Song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n    Meeting (Garden Of Geda) / Sound Out The Galleon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n    Dance Of Ranyart / Olias (To Build The Moorglade) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n    Qoquaq ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¹n Transic / Naon / Transic TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:08\n    Flight Of The Moorglade ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n    Solid Space ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n    Moon Ra / Chords / Song Of Search ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:48\n    To The Runner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b13bd17b62295e444a48158f24513c7798a668","amp;dn":"Olias+Of+Sunhillow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b13bd17b62295e444a48158f24513c7798a668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,177,59,209,123,98,41,94,68,74,72,21,143,36,81,60,119,152,166,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
