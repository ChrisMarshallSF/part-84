This was decrypted straight from the disc and re-compiled back into ISO format.  The ISO tested OK mounted through Alcohol 120% and loaded as a virtual disc on VLC Media Player.  However it has NOT been tested as burned to an actual DVD and thrown into a physical DVD Rom / DVD Player.  Also, it is NTSC format.\n\nSYNOPSIS: Guillermo del Toro made an auspicious and audacious feature debut with Cronos, a highly unorthodox tale about the seductiveness of the idea of immortality. Kindly antiques dealer JesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºs Gris (Federico Luppi) happens upon an ancient golden device in the shape of a scarab, and soon finds himself the possessor and victim of its sinister, addictive powers, as well as the target of a mysterious American named Angel (a delightfully crude and deranged Ron Perlman). Featuring marvelous special makeup effects and the haunting imagery for which del Toro has become world-renowned, Cronos is a dark, visually rich, and emotionally captivating fantasy.\n\nDisc Features\n\nDIRECTOR-APPROVED SPECIAL EDITION:\n\n    * New, restored high-definition digital transfer, supervised and approved by director Guillermo del Toro and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (with DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition)\n    * Optional original Spanish-language voice-over introduction\n    * Two audio commentaries, one featuring del Toro, the other producers Arthur H.
