He suspects Ali Bey, Turkish commander for the Dardanelles, and dispatches Annemarie to Constantinople to secure the proof. En route she becomes involved with Douglas Beall, a footloose American. Complications ensue, requiring Annemarie to engage in some dangerous improvisations.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025828/plotsummary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025828/plotsummary&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStamboul Quest bears the same name as a Graham Greene novel. However, this film has nothing to do with that novel. The Greene story was also filmed in 1934, but the Graham Greene film was given the title Orient Express (1934).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6cfa5f431d40f220bc99bbf0578f40648bb71e","amp;dn":"Stamboul+Quest+-USA1934-%28George+Brent%2C+Myrna+Loy%2C+Lionel+Atwill%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6cfa5f431d40f220bc99bbf0578f40648bb71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,108,250,95,67,29,64,242,32,188,153,187,240,87,143,64,100,139,183,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
