Rusted\n\nNew Wave / Darkwave band from Los Angeles, CA\n\nFrom http://wardour.bandcamp.com/ :\n\nABOUT THE BAND\n\nWardour is a darkwave project founded in 2011 by Thomas Matthew from Kalamazoo, MI (Now living in Los Angeles). With sole responsibility of the projects musical direction, Thomas is the project's song writer, guitarist, and vocalist.\n\n&quot;We wanted to share with the world what it feels like to be us on tape&quot; says Thomas Matthew front-man for the band WARDOUR.\n\nOf course there have been three piece bands before. Spanning all varieties of rock throughout the genre's inception; Jimi Hendrix &amp; the Experience, The Police, Nirvana, Husker Du. No band before has had such a big, dark sound with one set of drums, one guitar, and one bass.\n\nThis three piece band was formed when Thomas met the two other members sharing a rehearsal studio. Quickly building a friendship through music like none other before. WARDOUR's art comes from grappling with demons and setting them free through music.\n\n&quot;There is not one thing we compromise in either our studio work or live performance&quot; explains bassist L.A.. &quot;My goal and I think our goal is to take people who come to our shows out of their normal lives and into our world&quot;\n\nKeep an eye out for WARDOUR's upcoming release on Demotion records &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe9cc2ba8e33fe6e6ec6103f404991b38830a21","amp;dn":"WARDOUR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe9cc2ba8e33fe6e6ec6103f404991b38830a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,233,204,43,168,227,63,230,230,236,97,3,244,4,153,27,56,131,10,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
