Beautiful classical music!\n\nBit Rate: ~220 kbps (VBR).\n\nI hope you enjoy them as much as I do!\n\nThe music of Echochrome was composed by Hideki Sakamoto at the Tokyo-based sound design company Noisycroak. Most songs on the game score consist of a string quartet including two violins, a viola and a cello. However, three tracks include operatic vocals by singer Rumiko Kitazono. These are the opening themes to the Playstation Portable and Playstation 3 versions of the game, plus an additional theme that is unique to the soundtrack album.[13]\n\nTeam Entertainment published the original soundtrack to Echochrome on May 21, 2008 under the catalog number KDSD-00209. The performers included Hitoshi Konno (1st violin), Nagisa Kiriyama (2nd violin), Kazuo Watanabe (viola) and Ayano Kasahara (cello).[14] The composer had originally considered naming the game's individual tracks after philosophical terminology to match the title's abstract qualities, but later decided to use prime numbers so as not to color the songs with subjective interpretations.[15]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c943901c95aba6b541b74642f0d640d65955ac06","amp;dn":"Echochrome+Original+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c943901c95aba6b541b74642f0d640d65955ac06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,67,144,28,149,171,166,181,65,183,70,66,240,214,64,214,89,85,172,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
