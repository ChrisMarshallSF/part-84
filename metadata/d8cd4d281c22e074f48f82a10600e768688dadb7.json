I COULDN'T EDIT THE OTHER ONE! Don't download the old one, it doesn't work anymore!\n\nThis torrent was created by me, Tidosho. I've been a fan of racequeens \nfor years, and started this collection when I joined in 2007, and, using eMule and other sites, have collected all the previous stuff now removed from TopQueen. I've decided to provide the racequeen fan community with this single pack, as a tribute, and for avid TQ collectors.\n\nI do a backup every 12 months, this is my first one, so my next torrent \nwill be when i have the next 12 months. There is a recovery record included, to recover any damaged files.\n\nIt contains the following:\n\nMaidqueenz\n\n200803xx to the end of 201103xx\n\nTopqueen\n\n200405xx to the end of 201103xx\n\nTopqueen Excite\n\n200803xx to the end of 201103xx\n\nIf you do share contents of this, I ask that you give me credit, as I've been paying subscription fees to TopQueen, MaidQueenz and TopQueen Excite, they're all separate subscriptions, and it's cost me a lot over several years. They're not free sites.\n\nIf you would like to donate for me to keep doing this, it would be nice, I don't ask much, but it will enable me to continue paying subscriptions to provide you all with this sexy content. \nJust the odd Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£5 here and there, and I'll keep doing it as long as The Topqueen Ltd group do.\n\nBlog: http://tidelog.kitamuracomputers.com\n\nDonations (Via PayPal): &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a7d7c6decac2c9d3d4e7ccced3c6cad2d5c6c4c8cad7d2d3c2d5d489c4c8ca&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nMy company website: www.kitamuracomputers.com\n\nEnjoy! Give me feedback, to enable me to keep this torrent popular! I'll seed until there are at least two copies of this, or if there are too many snatch and grabbers keeping it from being seeded.\n\nTidosho","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8cd4d281c22e074f48f82a10600e768688dadb7","amp;dn":"UPDATED%21+Topqueen+Collection+up+to+March+2011+by+Tidosho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8cd4d281c22e074f48f82a10600e768688dadb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,205,77,40,28,34,224,116,244,143,130,161,6,0,231,104,104,141,173,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
