With time ticking\n                inexorably downwards, the marketing team come up with\n                a major public event to mark the '1000 days to go'\n                milestone. A huge clock designed by a modern British\n                artist will be installed outside the Tate Modern on\n                the banks of the Thames in a ceremony performed by\n                both Seb Coe and Boris Johnson and will count down\n                towards the start of the Olympic Games. The only\n                problem is that the clock has a potentially\n                disastrous design flaw which no-one seems to have\n                noticed until it's too late.
