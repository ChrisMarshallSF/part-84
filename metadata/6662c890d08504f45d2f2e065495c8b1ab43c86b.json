Corsi is best-known for his two New York Times bestselling books: The Obama Nation and Unfit for Command. He is also a journalist for the alternative news websites WorldNetDaily and Human Events. \n\n\nAlex also talks with pastor and former Alaskan pipeline missionary Lindsey Williams. In 2010, Williams, using oil industry insider sources, predicted the rise in oil and gas prices we are now enduring.\n\n\nToday's broadcast goes about 30 minutes into a 4th hour to conclude with Williams and air a special report by Aaron Dykes.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
