Their music uses three guitars as well as bass, drums, and now keyboards. Like many alternative country acts, the Drive-By Truckers record in analog (using 2 inch tape). However, unlike the majority of their contemporaries, the Drive-By Truckers have consistently pushed their labels to also release the band\\'s records in a vinyl format.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nGo-Go Boots is the title of the upcoming Drive-By Truckers \\&quot;R&amp;B murder\\&quot; album and is set to be released in the United States on February 15, 2011 and a day earlier elsewhere. This will be the Drive-By Truckers\\' ninth studio album (eleventh total). The album was recorded over three blocks of sessions resulting in 25 songs, which the band decided to split between The Big To-Do and its follow up Go-Go Boot\\'s. After The Big To-Do\\'s release, the band continued working on and tweaking the album throughout 2010. Go-Go Boots marks the eighth Drive-By Truckers album produced by David Barbe. Wes Freed will once again be providing the album artwork.\n\nGuitarist and frontman Patterson Hood has described the album to be the band\\'s \\&quot;most different and most Muscle Shoals sounding album.\\&quot; The Drive-By Trucker\\'s will include two covers by fellow Muscle Shoals artist Eddie Hinton on the album.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Go_Boots_%28album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Go_Boots_%28album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
