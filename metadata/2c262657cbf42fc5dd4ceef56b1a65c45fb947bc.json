Their first CD, &quot;Catharsis&quot;, was recorded in 2006 when the girls were just 15 and 16 years of age. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCatharsisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, has received airplay on a wide variety of NPR stations, and was featured on Fiona RitcheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Thistlepod&quot;, of all-American acoustic music. \n\nTheir new release, &quot;Everything is Alright&quot;, was published in late November, 2008. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEverything is Alright,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has been named &quot;Album of the Year 2009&quot; by the Celtic Radio Music Awards of Highland Radio, a 24-hour Internet radio station at CelticRadio.net.\n\nThe award acknowledges ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmusical creativity and extraordinary work on an album which provides recognition of exceptional contributions to Celtic music.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Two individual cuts on the album also won awards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThree SetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the jigs and reels category and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoldier, SoldierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the contemporary category.\n\nRose Baldino and Genna Gillespie met eight years ago as pre-teens at a traditional Irish music session where they became instant friends. Since that time, both have been first-place trophy winners at the Celtic Classic fiddle competitions. Both were born into musical families (GennaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parents are founding members of the Celtic band, Blackwater). The natural pairing of these talented young women, backed by Lou Baldino (guitar) and Peter Trezzi (djembe), has created a polished musical team with a captivating sound and a merry stage presence.\n\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name honors the memory of Bridget Cleary, a vivacious and fashionable young woman who lived in 19th century Ireland. Her husband and family burned poor Bridget to death, convinced that her flu symptoms were the result of her possession by evil fairies. The perpetrators were later convicted of murder, and laws were ultimately passed to protect women from such terrible acts. Bridget is now remembered as the last witch burned in Ireland, but we remember her as an innocent young woman.
