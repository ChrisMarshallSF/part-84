Three Yale grads, class of 1954, join their respective countries' secret service. We follow them for 40 years - through the outing of a British spy, the Hungarian revolution, the Bay of Pigs, the scent of moles, and the collapse of the USSR. Fictional characters - Yalies Jack McCauliffe, Leo Kritzky, and Yevgeny Tsipin and Jack's boss Harvey Torriti - rub shoulders with real figures like Kim Philby and James Angleton to tell stories of romance, intrigue, double-crosses, false leads, suicide, execution, and exile - in the name of ideology, patriotism, paranoia, perfidy, and one-upsmanship. Can the CIA claim any credit in the West's Cold War triumph?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4071743ff0fbee0b7429fbbf66470f2991e32d1","amp;dn":"The.Company.2007.DVDR.Disc.1%2F3.FINSUB+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4071743ff0fbee0b7429fbbf66470f2991e32d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,7,23,67,255,15,190,224,183,66,159,187,246,100,112,242,153,30,50,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
