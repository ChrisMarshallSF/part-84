Now a free man with a deadly to-do list in hand, he's finally on his mission...but with two men on his trail - a veteran cop (Billy Bob Thornton) just days from retirement, and a young egocentric hitman (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) with a flair for the art of killing and a newfound worthy opponent. The hunter is also the hunted. It's a do or die race to the list's finish as the mystery surrounding his brother's murder deepens, and new details emerge along the way hinting that Driver's list may be incomplete.\n\nCast:..........Dwayne Johnson, Billy Bob Thornton, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Carla Gugino, Maggie Grace, Moon Bloodgood\nDirector:......George Tillman Jr.\nWriters:.......Tony Gayton,Joe Gayton\nRun Time:......93 minutes\nRelease Date:..November 24th, 2010 \n\n[Please seed]\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f72eecf03e4cb196558d56f195d6cb176a13234a","amp;dn":"Faster%5BDvDRip%5D-Gkz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f72eecf03e4cb196558d56f195d6cb176a13234a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,46,236,240,62,76,177,150,85,141,86,241,149,214,203,23,106,19,35,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
