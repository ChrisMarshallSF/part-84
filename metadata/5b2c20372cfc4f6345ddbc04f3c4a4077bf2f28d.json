Ed Laurie is a singer-songwriter who puts\nthe music back into music.\nAttempting to describe his extraordinary songs, such names as Leonard Cohen,\nJacques Brel, Syd Barrett, Scott Walker and have all been floated. But like all\ngreat songwriters, Ed Laurie takes his influences and molds them into something\nnew and unique. Singing in a warm, baritone voice memorably described\nby one critic as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlike syrup on pancakes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ his haunting, heartfelt songs have that\nrare ability to take you to another place so that time seems to stand still while you\nlisten. Blending classic troubadour chords, Spanish guitar and Latin-tinged\nacoustic rhythms with literate, penetrating lyrics, it has been said he creates a\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmagical realism for the ears.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n*** Read more in the included PDF Bio (See folder Artwork &amp; Info) ***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in London, globetrotting British singer/songwriter Ed Laurie began his career as an actor, and though he flourished under the lights of the stage, the confidence he gleaned from the theater would eventually lead him back to his first love, music. Laurie's extended family in Eastern Europe, Germany, Spain, and Brazil have helped to shape his genre-defying sound. With a wide array of influences ranging from traditional singer/songwriters like Leonard Cohen and Fred Neil to legendary African singer CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©saria ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°vora and flamenco guitarist Paco PeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a, Laurie's thoughtful, atmospheric, warm, and occasionally melancholy songs have drawn comparisons to everyone from Syd Barrett to Jacques Brel. His seven-song self-released EP, Meanwhile in the Park, found success online both regionally and internationally, and resulted in a record deal with the Los Angeles-based Dangerbird label. His full-length debut for the label, Small Boat Big Sea, was slated for release in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Laurie - Small Boat Big Sea (2009)(Including 4 Bonus Tracks)(MP3@320)\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
