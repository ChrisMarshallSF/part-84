A number of relatives were located in the '90s, but none of them knew much about Pickett's life; he was the archetypal rambling blues singer, given to disappearing for months and years at a time, and silent about where he'd been. Dan Pickett is a paradox. His songs derive almost entirely from '30s commercial recordings, and repertoire and playing alike make his admiration for Tampa Red obvious and other. Yet his recordings are some of the most original downhome blues of their time or any other. Pickett's guitar is unpredictable, fluid and perfectly integrated with his singing, which is passionate, declamatory and as exuberant as his playing, often cramming a remarkable number of syllables into a line. Pickett takes other people's songs apart and rebuilds them, and although the originals are still recognizable, they are radically transformed, becoming the unmistakable, astonishing music of Dan Pickett. These are beautiful and very interesting recordings.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4300038c05875099e42589205027d00692e175a8","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Dan+Pickett+-+1949+Country+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4300038c05875099e42589205027d00692e175a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,0,3,140,5,135,80,153,228,37,137,32,80,39,208,6,146,225,117,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
