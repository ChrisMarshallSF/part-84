Created by Adam F. Goldberg and Seth Gordon, the series centers on a team of uniquely skilled oddball geniuses hand-picked to work for a manipulative mastermind. Contra Security, corporate America's answer to &quot;The A-Team,&quot; gives clients a sense of security by first ripping it away. The firm is led by Oz (Christian Slater), a larger-than-life head honcho who is a man of mystery and master of manipulation. The members of the odd squad include alluring bad girl Melanie (Odette Yustman), who is in charge of lock-picking, safe-cracking and heart-breaking; and CASH (Alphonso McAuley), a fan boy who specializes in strategy, logistics and office pranks only a mad genius could think up.\n\n---\n\nBreaking In - S01E01\n\nAir date: 04/06/2011 \n\nPilot\nContra Security, is corporate AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s answer to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe A-Team.&quot;\n\n---\n\nFile\nBreaking In - S01E01.avi\nStorlek\n177456 kB (173 MB)\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngd\n00:21:11\nDemuxer\navi\n\nKlippinfo\nMjukvara\nLavf52.102.0\n\nVideo\nUpplÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶sning\n640 x 360\nBildformat\n1.7778\nFormat\nXVID\nBitar/sek\n1002 kbps\nBildrutor/sekund\n23.976\nVald codec\nffodivx\n\nInitialljudstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m\nFormat\n85\nBitar/sek\n128 kbps\nFrekvens\n48000 Hz\nKanaler\n2\nVald codec\nffmp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d10dcce87ef58ea55efd213ed477676d52e72e08","amp;dn":"Breaking+In+-+S01E01.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d10dcce87ef58ea55efd213ed477676d52e72e08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,13,204,232,126,245,142,165,94,253,33,62,212,119,103,109,82,231,46,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
