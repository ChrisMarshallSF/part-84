After the last taping, Alexandra allowed the Dr. Phil cameras to get a glimpse of a day in her life. See where sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s living and how she spends her days. Next, find out if Alexandra is truly working to get her life back on track, or if sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s let Tony derail her progress. Dr. Phil drills down to determine why Alexandra settles for men with troubled pasts, and she breaks down in tears while making a surprising admission. And, Alexandra hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen her children in more than three weeks, and broke a promise she made to her 3-year-old daughter, Leilah. Are drugs to blame? Plus, watch the hostile exchanges between Alexandra and her mom, Erin, and see whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s driving a wedge between mother and daughter now?
