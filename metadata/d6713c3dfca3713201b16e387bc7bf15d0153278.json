If anything, the group sounds leaner and meaner. Hard Times in the Land of Plenty is one of their finest releases for this reason. It's a rough and tumble collection that is driven as much by fine original songwriting as it is by the band's edgy sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nOmar Dykes (vocals, guitar); \nReese Wynans (organ); \nNeil Pederson (synthesizer); \nBruce Jones (bass); \nGene Brandon (drums).\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 Hard Times In The Land Of Plenty   \n02 Dancing In The Canebrake   \n03 Border Girl See  \n04 Mississippi Hoo Doo Man    \n05 Don't Rock Me the Wrong Way   \n06 Same Old Grind    \n07 Don't You Know    \n08 You Ain't Foolin' Nobody  \n09 Shadow Man   \n10 Lee Anne \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6713c3dfca3713201b16e387bc7bf15d0153278","amp;dn":"Omar+%26+The+Howlers+-+Hard+Times+In+The+Land+Of+Plenty++%5B1987%5D++%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6713c3dfca3713201b16e387bc7bf15d0153278","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,113,60,61,252,163,113,50,1,177,110,56,123,199,191,21,208,21,50,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
