The pursuit leads him through a world that has become his own natural habitat - a nasty world of crime, drugs, prostitution and male hustlers where &quot;innocence kills&quot; and continued exposure corrupts. Paradoxically, it's also a world of love, secret admirers, romantic feminist poets and modern chivalry. And for the viewer, it's the background for an exciting, suspense movie.\n\n\nHard to find movie...\n\n\nNot my rip.\n\n\nRunning Time: 01:50:44\n\n\nVIDEO INFO:\n\nCodec Name: XviD MPEG-4\n\nKBit Rate (KBit/Sec.): 687\n\nResolution: 624 x 336\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1\n\nFrame Rate (Frame/Sec.): 23,976\n\nColor Depth: 12 Bits\n\nQuality Factor: 0,136 B/px\n\n\nAUDIO INFO:\n\nCodec Name: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\n\nSample Rate (Sample/Sec.): 48000 Hz\n\nKBit Rate (KBit/Sec.): 192 (CBR)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a0ccfe40b1def9ae9147f9196a9dbb9ab470030","amp;dn":"Cop+%281988%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a0ccfe40b1def9ae9147f9196a9dbb9ab470030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,12,207,228,11,29,239,154,233,20,127,145,150,169,219,185,171,71,0,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
