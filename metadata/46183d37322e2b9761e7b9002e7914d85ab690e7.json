A re-imagining of the 1983 miniseries created by Kenneth Johnson, the new series chronicles the arrival on Earth of a technologically advanced alien species which ostensibly comes in peace, but actually has sinister motives.\n\nGiant spaceships appear over 29 major cities throughout the world, and Anna (Morena Baccarin), the beautiful and charismatic leader of the extraterrestrial \\\\\\&quot;Visitors\\\\\\&quot;, declares that they come in peace. The Visitors claim to only need a small amount of Earth\\\\\\'s resources, in exchange for which they will share their advanced technological and medical knowledge. As a small number of humans begin to doubt the sincerity of the seemingly benevolent Visitors, FBI counter-terrorism agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell) discovers that the aliens are actually reptilian humanoids wearing pseudo-human skin, have spent decades infiltrating human governments, businesses and religious institutions, and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the Earth. Erica joins the resistance movement, which includes Ryan (Morris Chestnut), a Visitor sleeper agent who over time developed human emotions and now wants to save humanity. Their rebellion is further challenged as the Visitors have won favor among the people of Earth by curing a variety of diseases, and have recruited Earth\\\\\\'s youthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including Erica\\\\\\'s son Tyler (Logan Huffman)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to serve them unknowingly as spies.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_V_%282009_TV_series%29_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_V_%282009_TV_series%29_episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\tXviD\nFile size:  \t350MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t42min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23,976fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t10 + 1 TitlePic + 1 txt\n                (First episode is recoded to implement KABLAM!!!-Trailer)\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn\\\\\\'t have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\nVISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46183d37322e2b9761e7b9002e7914d85ab690e7","amp;dn":"V+2009+-+Complete+Season+2+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46183d37322e2b9761e7b9002e7914d85ab690e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,24,61,55,50,46,43,151,97,231,185,0,46,121,20,216,90,182,144,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
