Featuring contributions from leading researchers in the field, this book uniquely discusses both the contemporary experimental and computational manifestations of soft condensed matter systems. \n\nFrom particle tracking and image analysis, novel materials and computational methods, to confocal microscopy and bacterial assays, this book will equip the reader for collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts relating to a range of modern problems in nonlinear and non-equilibrium systems. It will enable both graduate students and experienced researchers to supplement a more traditional understanding of thermodynamics and statistical systems with knowledge of the techniques used in contemporary investigations\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65784a5365fcf12e48a20172b286b7237d100e6","amp;dn":"Experimental+and+Computational+Techniques+in+Soft+Condensed+Matt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65784a5365fcf12e48a20172b286b7237d100e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,87,132,165,54,95,207,18,228,138,32,23,43,40,107,114,55,209,0,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
