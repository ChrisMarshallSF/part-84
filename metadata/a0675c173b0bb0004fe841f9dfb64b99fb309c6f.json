They've named it\n              &quot;Orang Pendek&quot; - the little man of the forest. A\n              recent scientific discovery proposes that another\n              species of humans - nicknamed 'hobbits' - did once\n              live in Indonesia. So could there be a new great ape\n              waiting to be discovered? Or is it possible we're not\n              the only human species living on earth?
