Her father and his father planted the seed that would blossom in the heart of a six-year old kicking at the dirt on a country road in Florida. The same roads where her grandfather Roy, moaned the lovesick blues and even wrote a song recorded by The Hillbilly Shakespeare himself. That road would lead young Sonia Leigh to many places to call home in her future. Moving around so much with her family gave Sonia the fire to always keep going and to become resilient to new places. Her Father Dennis used to let her bang away on his guitar and later when she was ten years old began teaching chords and strumming techniques which would build the foundation for a mansion of talent. \n\nTaking some time to release her third record, &quot;Run or Surrender&quot; Sonia Leigh was determined to give her songwriting time to mature and develop into its full potential. She now has a collection of material equipt with nail driving lyrics and melodies that will stick with you for days. Songs that mark a highlight in her career and has her music peers singing along. Sonia Leigh is making the rounds and building a following as she goes.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/21/sonia-leigh/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:937a1229bbfaaf44444ac42ae1f3e7a02582a1a5","amp;dn":"Sonia+Leigh...Run+or+Surrender%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"937a1229bbfaaf44444ac42ae1f3e7a02582a1a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,122,18,41,187,250,175,68,68,74,196,42,225,243,231,160,37,130,161,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
