R5  (2010)\n\nStarring: Hayden Christensen, Thandie Newton and John Leguizamo\n\nWhen a massive power outage plunges the city of Detroit into total darkness, a disparate group of individuals find themselves alone. The entire city's population has vanished into thin air, leaving behind heaps of empty clothing, abandoned cars and lengthening shadows. Soon the daylight begins to disappear completely, and as the survivors gather in an abandoned tavern, they realize the darkness is out to get them, and only their rapidly diminishing light sources can keep them safe.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1452628/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1452628/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRuntime         : 1:27:35\n\nVideo \t\t: H264 AVC\n\nBitrate\t\t: 450 Kbps\n\nPasses\t\t: 2\n\nAudio Codec\t: AAC Dolby Pro Logic II\n\nBitrate\t\t: 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nEncoded using Handbrake.\n\nThanks goes out to On.Off.On.\n\n\nEnjoy and Please help me Seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e5f041acbac2c89841e103148cb1e93f94f9b3","amp;dn":"Vanishing.on.7th.Street.R5.%28Ipod%2C+Zune%2C+Psp%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e5f041acbac2c89841e103148cb1e93f94f9b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,229,240,65,172,186,194,200,152,65,225,3,20,140,177,233,63,148,249,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
