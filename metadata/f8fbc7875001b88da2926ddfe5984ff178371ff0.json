He has always loved music, and in 2004 he did his first rhyme. He started out recording freestyle rhymes with his brother, and his interest for music grew and grew. In 2009, Staz first promo video \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Knock\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Em Out RMX\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; came out, with Malik aka Silk E, from The Outhere Brothers.\n\nThat was just the beginning. Right now he is featured on many different projects. Besides his own stuff he is featured on 2 lead singles for the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Legends And Diamonds\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; project: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Change The World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Thing Called Love\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. After dropping a sucessful solo album \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Is This Me\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; in July 2010 he had hundreds of thousands of views and listens all over the net, becoming the most promising artist in the whole ex-USSR area. Stay tuned for more stuff and keep supporting this young artist.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;I never said i will become the best rapper or the best musician or whatever, but i will surely keep bringing good music in this crazy world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - Staz said in his first radio interview on Capital FM 101.0\n\nHaving collaborated with tens of artists from Australia to Vietnam Staz really shows the possibilities to spread the good music with the help of the internet.
