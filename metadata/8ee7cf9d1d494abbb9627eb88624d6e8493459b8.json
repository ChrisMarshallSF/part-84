But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the      \n    heart of an iron and steel-producing complex that          \n    fuelled the spread of empire.                             \n                                                             \n    Over three days the Team fight through the undergrowth    \n    to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw    \n    materials of industry under appalling conditions.         \n                                                             \n    As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the    \n    archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs    \n    of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site.   \n    And with the help of old records they can even put       \n    names and trades to the people who occupied the           \n    workers' cottages that once stood alongside the works.     \n                                                              \n    It's a story of how cottage industry gave way to the     \n    might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and     \n    the Team uncover the highs and lows of the working life    \n    of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how    \n    excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge   \n    lumps of 200-year-old slag!                               \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee7cf9d1d494abbb9627eb88624d6e8493459b8","amp;dn":"Time.Team.S18E05.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee7cf9d1d494abbb9627eb88624d6e8493459b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,231,207,157,29,73,74,187,185,98,126,184,134,36,214,232,73,52,89,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
