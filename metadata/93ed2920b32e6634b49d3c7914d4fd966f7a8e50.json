For the first time ever, celebrate Walt Disney's lumbering, lovable, and eternally loyal everyman in this retrospective of his classic animated shorts and enjoy the heyday of one of the most popular characters in cartoon history. Unlike the rest of Disney's mouse pack, Goofy didn't become a major movie star overnight. This compilation of shorts begins with the Goof's first starring role. The volume also includes animator Art Babbitt's original descriptive reference of all things Goofy, the original voice behind the Goof, Pinto Colvig, and an exclusive interview with the current voice of Goofy, Bill Farmer. You'll also have the opportunity to see theatrical posters and other memorabilia, a selection of story drawings, and background paintings. After all, it's the Goofy thing to do. Featuring exclusive introductions by film historian Leonard Maltin, this is a timeless collection from generations past for generations to come. \n\n\n\nFormat                                       : AVI\nAudio                                         : MPEG@128 Kbps.English 2 channels\nCodec                                        : DivX \nBit rate                                      : from 1 600 Kbps to 1 800 Kbps\nWidth                                        : 608 pixels\nHeight                                       : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                  : 4:3\nInfo                                          : http://www.amazon.com/Walt-Disney-Treasures-Complete-Goofy/dp/B00006II6N[/QUOTE]\n[/CENTER]\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/85838469933231161021.jpeg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/89394277128409867655.jpeg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/76095978789109894375.jpeg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://leetleech.org/][IMG]http://leetleech.org/images/88476423188792845756.jpeg[/IMG][/URL][/CENTER]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93ed2920b32e6634b49d3c7914d4fd966f7a8e50","amp;dn":"Walt+Disney+Treasures+The+Complete+Goofy+-+Team+MJY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93ed2920b32e6634b49d3c7914d4fd966f7a8e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,237,41,32,179,46,102,52,180,157,60,121,20,212,253,150,111,122,142,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
