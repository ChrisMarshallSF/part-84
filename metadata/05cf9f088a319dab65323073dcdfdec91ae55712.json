Dyke and William Dear. Commenting on how their generation was often stereotyped \nand judged by their outward appearances, the film was obviously inspired by the carefree counter culture attitude of EASY RIDER, \nas well as the excessive comic book violence of THE WILD BUNCH, two of the most popular films of their era. \nThe much deserved cult status for NORTHVILLE has been a rather quiet one, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost as if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen it, \nyouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re part of a private club. One of the most surprising titles to get the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspecial editionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ treatment, \nVCI has kindly obliged with this rousing DVD release.\n\n\nBlonde ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhippyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Chris (David Hyry) tags along with the biker club the Spirits (played by real members \nof the Scorpions motorcycle club) after offering one of them some homegrown weed. When the Spirits hold a rowdy outdoor wedding, \nChris meets up with his girlfriend Lynn (Jan Sisk) and they proceed to make love in a nearby barn. After the law arrives \non the scene, the corrupt Deputy Putnam (Craig Collicot) knocks out Chris and forces himself sexually on Lynn, \nwarning her not to tell anyone. When Lynn ends up in the hospital, Putnam convinces her furious father (Herb Sharples) \nthat the bikers are responsible for her rape, and the two play sniper against the Spirits with the help of a wealthy hunter \n(Len Speck). The Spirits look for clues as to whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been knocking off their people, confronting a rival biker club \nat a deserted drive-in, and eventually arming themselves with the proper artillery. Everything leads up to a bloody showdown \nin a cemetery, which has a three-coffin biker funeral interrupted by trigger-happy antagonists hovering over in a helicopter.\n\n\nHyped as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Ultimate Biker Flick,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ NORTHVILLE CEMETERY MASSACRE may or may not be that, but it certainly ranks among \nthe most intriguing cycle pictures and is an all-out satisfying slice of exploitation that can even be classified as a \nmodern Western. From the opening moments -- featuring the Spirits toying with an old couple pulled over on the road, \nonly to repair their flat tire -- you know this is not your typical AIP or Crown International biker fare. The bearded, \nlonghaired Harley riders here are posed as misunderstood rebels who just want to have a good time, and the Scorpions \nof course play them authentically and with pathos. No oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gonna win any performance accolades here, \nbut the rest of the cast is made up of local actors who hold things up well. Interestingly enough, \nlead actor Hyry was over-dubbed by an easily recognizable Nick Nolte some years before he became a household name.\n\n\nThe filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s WILD BUNCH-style violence is displayed in the numerous slow-mo shootings, complete with exploding blood squibs, \nall which are impressively photographed. The violence is offset by some clever satire, including a scene where the Spirits \nare ordered by a judge to ride their bikes through a car wash, and an oddball arms salesman giving a Patton-like speech \nin front of a hanging U.S. flag. Ex-Monkee Mike Nesmith (an underrated solo artist in his own right) \ndid the country/rock score in a raunchy style that really befits the film (someone should release a soundtrack CD pronto!). \nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interesting to note that the film started production in 1971 (pretty much the year that the biker film had died) \nand completed over a period of a few years, though not released theatrically until 1976 by Cannon.\n\n\nShot on 16mm and later blown up to 35 for theatrical showings, NORTHVILLE CEMETERY MASSACRE has been ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdigitally re-masteredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for DVD. \nAside from some blemishes and grain caused by the original 16mm film stock, the picture looks quite good, with crisp detail and vivid colors. \nThe mono audio track also comes of well, and optional Spanish subtitles are included.\n\n\nVCI has furnished the disc with a lot of supplements, including three (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right, three!) separate audio commentaries. \nThe first one is from co-director/co-producer/co-screenwriter Thomas L. Dyke. Dyke shares a lot of behind-the-scenes recollections, \ndispersed (with some dead space) in what appears to be pre-written form, as heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s apparently not watching the film. \nBut what he says comes off as interesting, including a meeting with director Robert Altman and details about all \nthe post and pre production headaches. The second commentary, with co-director/co-producer/co-screenwriter William Dear, \nis the best of the three tracks. DearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talk is thorough and scene-specific, and he remembers a lot of details, \nincluding how leftover hamburgers were added to the squibs to make them look really gross. \nA third commentary is with members of the Scorpions, and Dyke is also present, sometimes throwing questions at them. \nThis track is all over the place and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to tell who's who as nobody is properly introduced, but it can be fun to \nhear some of the no-holds-barred comments. There are two still galleries. One of them has behind-the-scenes stills and contains \nsome opening narration by Dyke (talking about his initial meeting with the Scorpions), and the other features various video covers \nas well as German lobby cards. Bios are included on Dear, Dyke and the Scorpions, and there are some trailers for other VCI DVD releases.\nGeorge R.
