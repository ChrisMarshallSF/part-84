Michelle says her husband, Jim, has controlled her for the 15 years that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been together, and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fed up with his faultfinding. She says he tells her what to wear, how much she should eat, and even uses a GPS to track her whereabouts! Jim admits that his behavior is out of control and fears that he could be pushing his wife out the door. Why is he so critical of Michelle, and can Dr. Phil get the judgmental hubby to change his ways? Then, Sally says her husband, John, is so controlling that she spends most of her days picking up dust bunnies from the floor and only speaking when he allows her to. John says cleanliness is next to godliness and believes control is a matter of perception. See what causes him to go toe to toe with Dr. Phil! Will the couple get the help theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re seeking? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an explosive Dr. Phil you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to miss!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c05bac876518ea3a6ce572081f3f65cc4b168a2c","amp;dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2011.02.09.Bossy.Husbands.HDTV.Xvid-NBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c05bac876518ea3a6ce572081f3f65cc4b168a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,91,172,135,101,24,234,58,108,229,114,8,31,63,101,204,75,22,138,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
