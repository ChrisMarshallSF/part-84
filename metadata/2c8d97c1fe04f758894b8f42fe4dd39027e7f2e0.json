The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c8d97c1fe04f758894b8f42fe4dd39027e7f2e0","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+XXX+-+8.162+P3+-+Chinese+-+Diskettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c8d97c1fe04f758894b8f42fe4dd39027e7f2e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,141,151,193,254,4,247,88,137,75,143,66,254,77,211,144,39,231,242,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
