The Picts, under their king, Gorlacon, are perfecting guerilla warfare and are eliminating Roman outposts one by one. Centurion Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a Pictish raid and is taken prisoner by Vortix. In the meantime, Agricola, the Roman governor of Britannia wants to obtain favour with the central administration, hoping to secure a transfer back to the comforts of Rome. He dispatches the Ninth Legion to the front under General Titus Flavius Virilus, with orders to eradicate the Pict threat, providing him with a mute female Brigantian scout, Etain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee490800982f68bbf12e6f51486503f67d38a33","amp;dn":"GPB-Centurion+%282010%29+Greek+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee490800982f68bbf12e6f51486503f67d38a33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,228,144,128,9,130,246,139,191,18,230,245,20,134,80,63,103,211,138,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
