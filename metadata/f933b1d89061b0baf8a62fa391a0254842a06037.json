DeGraw believes what we are seeing in Wisconsin, Egypt, Tunisia and all over the world is a decentralized global rebellion against neo-liberal global economic policies. He believes the Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, the IMF and the World Bank are the constituents of this destructive force.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ampedstatus.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ampedstatus.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is extracted audio from the Press TV video.
