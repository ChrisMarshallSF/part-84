Camp Meeting on the 4th of July 3:08  \n\nChris Coole is a Toronto based clawhammer banjo player of some renown (in fact he may be one of the best in the world). HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s played with and for some great artists over the years (Jenny Whiteley, Jim Cuddy, Sylvia Tyson, and Justin Rutledge.) But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s with this, his first solo record, Old Dog, that Chris has really stepped out/up. The album features 5 original songs as well as some traditional numbers and covers of songs by The Band, John Hartford and Dave Dudley. The record also features friends on fiddle, pedal steel, mandola, cello and percussion. The song styles range from traditional folk to honky-tonk to contemporary bluegrass. I like that Old Dog has a nice, easy, casual feel. The record sounds organic and the songs are a natural for ChrisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ laid back vocal delivery and masterful guitar/banjo playing. \n\nIt was hard to pick just one song since thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a variety of styles on the record and since there are so many fine songs. But I forced myself to choose one and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the Chris Coole original ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHell To PayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (although a close second was either the title track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOld DogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the duet called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Bottle Got The Best Of MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that reminded me of Prine/Dement, or the John Hartford cover ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWish We Had Our Time TogetherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/20/chris-coole/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/20/chris-coole/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1df63522464e14172d644e59745ab6c8f5f98f","amp;dn":"Chris+Coole...Old+Dog%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1df63522464e14172d644e59745ab6c8f5f98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,29,246,53,34,70,78,20,23,45,100,78,89,116,90,182,200,245,249,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
