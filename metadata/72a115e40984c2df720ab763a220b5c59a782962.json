I tell \nabout each step in my journey from stress and suffering into sustained \npeace. I share the origins of the maps I created, as well as my first \nencounters with other peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s maps that helped along the way. \n\nMy intent is to clearly communicate as much of my experience as I believe \nwill be useful and applicable to your unique journeys. After the story, I \nrevisit each of the maps, summarize them, and suggest some ways to apply \nthem in your own life. I also tell where to find more information about \nthe maps I learned from other people. \n\nThe story is one that many people tell me is truly inspirational. The maps \nI share are ones that brought peace and empowerment to my life and have \nshown significant potential to do the same for others. \n\nThis 2 CD set contains almost two hours (115 min) of audio, recorded at \nDrum Music Studios with sound engineering by Steve Briskman . The first \n80 min or so is narrative and the other 30 min is the recap of the maps. \n\nThis studio quality audio recording has replaced the original \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Bootstrap EditionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lo-fi video and was recorded using a minor edit \nof the same script. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a much higher quality product than the DVDs were, \nand I believe the audio format is more suitable for this story as well. It \nalso follows the script I wrote more closely than the video did, and has \nbetter pacing, delivering the same information as the video in 25 minutes \nless time.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a115e40984c2df720ab763a220b5c59a782962","amp;dn":"finding.accord.by.taylor.brown.cdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a115e40984c2df720ab763a220b5c59a782962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,161,21,228,9,132,194,223,114,10,183,99,162,32,181,197,154,120,41,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
