You can disable some or all of them by doing so:\n\n   1. Start your World of Warcraft by launching Wow(.exe) in your WoW directory and login to your account.\n   2. In the character selection screen, bottom left corner you will see a button Addons. Click it. Addon window will pop out.\n   3. Click Disable All in the bottom-left corner of the addon box (or untick ones you don't need) and hit Okay in the middle-right-bottom part of the window. Now your UI will be standard and clean.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:287c556c7263ef6bfc7c8f76e1d5386b3e3765cd","amp;dn":"WoW+TBC+2.4.3+%5Btbc.SunFire.lt%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"287c556c7263ef6bfc7c8f76e1d5386b3e3765cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,124,85,108,114,99,239,107,252,124,143,118,225,213,56,107,62,55,101,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
