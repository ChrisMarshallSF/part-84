When you open a macro\nfile in EmEditor, keywords, such as\nmacro objects, properties, or\nmethods, are automatically\nhighlighted. For assistance on\ncertain keywords, move the cursor\nover the keyword and select Search\nfor Keyword, or press F1.\n\nWhen an error occurs during the\nexecution of a macro, a dialog box\nwill appear showing the content of\nthe error. If you click on the Edit\nbutton, you can jump to the location\nwhere the error occurred.\n\nEmEditor uses JavaScript or VBScript\nfor its macro language, so those who\nare familiar with HTML or Windows\nscripting will be able to write\nmacros with little difficulty.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with scripting\nlanguages, EmEditor can record\nkeystrokes that can then be saved in\na macro file, which can easily be\nloaded in different situations. With\nthe use of JavaScript or VBScript,\nyou can also troubleshoot your code\neasily.\n\nURL: http://www.emurasoft.com\n\niNSTALL NOTES\n\n1.) Unpack and install\n2.)
