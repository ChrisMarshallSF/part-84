(Same quality, smaller file.)\n\nI have not managed to find a solution for removing the numerous little discontinuities. They are too many for a manual edit, some kind of (semi-)automatic solution would be needed. If you know how this could be done, please tell me in the comments. (I kept the .wav file for further editing.)\n\nAs always, please seed after you are done downloading. This is a great mix, it deserves your bandwidth. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc17de095563047fd521d2a38f6ac768be4ddbfc","amp;dn":"John+00+Fleming+-+Live+at+1015+San+Francisco+2010.11.20+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc17de095563047fd521d2a38f6ac768be4ddbfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,23,222,9,85,99,4,127,213,33,210,163,143,106,199,104,190,77,219,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
