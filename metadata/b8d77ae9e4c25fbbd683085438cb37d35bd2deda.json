Meanwhile, one of Ben's alters spends the night drinking heavily with an old friend of his wife, and when he wakes up, she appears to have overdosed. \n\nAccording to wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_%282010_TV_series%29 ), this is actually episode 6, but this wasn't aired by Showcase Canada in their initial run of 10 of the 13 episodes.\n\nThis episode was recorded from The Accessible Channel (TAC - http://www.theaccessiblechannel.com/ ) on Jan 20, 2011. Apparently it aired on Showcase Canada on Dec 31, 2010, but it was not recorded at that time.\n\nThis episode is in described video, which means that much of the onscreen action is described in the audio in addition to the regular audio. The effect is a bit disconcerting, but shouldn't be a big problem for fans of this show.\n\nThe video quality is quite watchable but nowhere near the quality of HDTV scene releases. This was recorded from a non-HD source.  \n\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Shattered.S01E11.She.Had.You.Fooled.READ.TXT.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            367,118,336 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             44:01.326\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         368\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              989 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              109 kbps\nBitrate Type:         VBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8d77ae9e4c25fbbd683085438cb37d35bd2deda","amp;dn":"Shattered+S01E11+She+Had+You+Fooled+READ+TXT+WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8d77ae9e4c25fbbd683085438cb37d35bd2deda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,215,122,233,228,194,95,187,214,131,8,84,56,203,55,211,91,210,222,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
