As Mick &quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee sits in a canoe sharpening his famous knife, a monstrous croc hides somewhere in the deep. Suddenly, it attacks, tearing Mick's boat to pieces and leaving him and mate Jacko up a tree. Life for Mick can only get easier, right? When Mick arrives at home, he discovers longtime companion Sue's newspaper-mogul father has called, and needs her help on an article at the paper's Los Angeles branch. Mick, who recognizes his importance in the modernizing bush is now no more than as a tourist attraction, agrees to join her, and together Mick, Sue, and son Mikey head for the wild country of L.A. Here the adventure truly begins, as Mick and Jacko brave a cowboy bar where the horsemen are of a different color, and a Hollywood film party where everyone seems interested in Mick's mate Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Gibson's colorful exploits. Soon, Sue's article leads to a sleazy film producer, so Mick gets a job as a monkey wrangler at his studio, where his investigation uncovers some very sketchy goings-on.  \n\n\n\nIMDB:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0231402/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0231402/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCrocodile Dundee I\n\nOverall bit rate                 : 5.777 Kb/s\nWriting library                  : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\n\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95ddfcf2fdd5d9a1bba4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 6 klatek\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 29 min.\nBit rate                         : 5.389 Kb/s\nWidth                            : 1.280 pikseli\nHeight                           : 544 pikseli\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2,35:1\nFrame rate                       : 25,000 kl/s\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³w\nScan type                        : Progresywny\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.310\nStream size                      : 3,29 GB (91%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 65 r1069M ed32ad2\nEncoding settings                : cabac=1 / ref=6 / deblock=1:-2:-1 / analyse=0x3:0x113 / me=umh / subme=9 / psy_rd=2.0:0.0 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=24 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=2 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=3 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / mbaff=0 / bframes=5 / b_pyramid=1 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / wpredb=1 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40(pre) / rc=2pass / bitrate=5389 / ratetol=2.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / pb_ratio=1.30 / aq=1:1.00 filip2709\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nDuration                         : 1h 29 min.\nBit rate mode                    : StaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡a\nBit rate                         : 384 Kb/s\nChannel(s)                       : 2 kanaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡y\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48,0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³w\nStream size                      : 245 MB (7%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nTHANKS NLUPPER\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42476087001425ad21cbe46b40b947c2db92e3a","amp;dn":"Crocodile+Dundee+123+HDTV+720p+x264+ac3+2ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42476087001425ad21cbe46b40b947c2db92e3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,36,118,8,112,1,66,90,210,28,190,70,180,11,148,124,45,185,46,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
