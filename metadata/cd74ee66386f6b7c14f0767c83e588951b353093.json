The show features Donkey Kong, a peace-loving, hugely strong ape with a big heart but a small brain who lives with his friends in the jungle. They are plagued by the evil King Karro, who wants to defeat Donkey Kong because he possesses the Crystal Coconut, a mystical sphere that can perform spells. But, in Donkey Kong country, the good guys always win out with a bit of know-how - and a lot of luck. Join in the antics - there's plenty of action in this here jungle!\n\nContains The Following 4 Episodes:\n\nHooray For Holly-Kongo Bongo\n\nEveryone wants in on the act as Bluster gets ready to produce and direct his first feature film. While Bluster is in it for the money, Donkey Kong figures it's a good way to impress Candy. King K. Rool, well, he just wants to use those acting lessons he bought over the phone.\n\nThe Kongo Bongo Festival of Lights\n\nTis the season for gift-giving and fireworks. It's also the one day of the year that there's a truce between the Apes and Lizards. The Apes sit around the Crystal Coconut and exchange gifts, while the Lizards go home to the swamps to be with their loved-ones and drink Bog-Nog. The Crystal Coconut is safe... or is it?\n\nSpeak No Evil, Dude\n\nWhile cutting through the mine tunnel, Diddy overhears King K. Rool's plans to take over the island. Unfortunately, the symptoms for Kongo Bongo Gone Wrongo disease have begun and Diddy hasn't been vaccinated. However, by the time he reaches Donkey Kong to warn him, he is at stage four of the disease and Diddy has lost his voice.\n\nThe Day The Island Stood Still\n\nIt's a day like any other on the island while Donkey Kong and Diddy guard the Crystal Coconut. Diddy tries in vain to get past level three of his video game and Donkey Kong, weary from all the hard &quot;work&quot; settles down for a nap proclaiming that he wishes he could &quot;sleep forever&quot;. Suddenly Kongo Bongo Island stands still!\n\nScreen Formats:\nFull Frame 1.33:1\n\nLanguage and Sound:\nEnglish Dolby Digital Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd74ee66386f6b7c14f0767c83e588951b353093","amp;dn":"Donkey+Kong+Country+%28TV+Series%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd74ee66386f6b7c14f0767c83e588951b353093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,116,238,102,56,111,107,124,20,240,118,124,131,229,136,149,27,53,48,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
