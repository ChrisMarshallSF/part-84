From their\nm2ts sample you can see their source is Region A, same as\nours, which means discs should look the same or atleast\nsimiliar. As you can see from our pic proof that we\nincluded they are no where near the same. Their disc even\nhas pixelation as if it was taken from the encoded video.\nThey have had many Questionable proofs since the new rules\nhave taken effect... We feel enough is enough, as it is\njust being disrespectful to all hard working x264 groups\nout there. So here is a REAL RETAiL Rip for those that care\nabout quality,the old spirit of the scene and fair competition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bccc4a62a6132e380494adabb922c6ed0d5ae07d","amp;dn":"Black.Swan.PROPER.720p.BluRay.x264-TWiZTED.BOZX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bccc4a62a6132e380494adabb922c6ed0d5ae07d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,204,74,98,166,19,46,56,4,148,173,171,185,34,198,237,13,90,224,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
