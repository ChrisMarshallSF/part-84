Hundreds of students have been arrested and some have reported being beaten, including sexually harassed and tortured in the ensuing crackdown. Democracy Now! co-host Juan Gonzalez comments on the students' uprising.\n\n\n- &quot;People Are Bleeding in the Streets:&quot; Bahrain Police Wage Brutal Overnight Attack on Hundreds of Pro-Democracy Protesters\n\nDuring an overnight raid in the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain, heavily armed riot police surrounded thousands of demonstrators as they slept in a central square in the nation's capital. Rubber bullets, tear gas and concussion grenades were fired into the crowd without warning. At least four people were killed and hundreds injured. Some 60 people are reported missing. We hear from human right activist Nabeel Rajab outside a hospital in Manama where the wounded are being treated.\n\n\n- &quot;The Genies Are Out of the Bottle&quot;: Assessing a Changing Arab World with Noam Chomsky and Al Jazeera's Marwan Bishara\n\nMassive public protests continue to sweep the Middle East and North Africa in countries including Bahrain, Libya, Yemen and Iran-many being met with violent government crackdowns. We speak to Marwan Bishara, senior political analyst at Al Jazeera English and MIT Professor Emeritus Noam Chomsky. &quot;Perhaps the Arab moment has come,&quot; Bishara says, &quot;It is clear the genies are out of the bottle. I think change is coming to the Arab world.&quot;\n\n\n- &quot;Democracy Uprising&quot; in the USA?: Noam Chomsky on Wisconsin's Resistance to Assault on Public Sector, the Obama-Sanctioned Crackdown on Activists, and the Distorted Legacy of Ronald Reagan\n\nWorld-renowned public intellectual Noam Chomsky discusses several domestic issues in the United States, including the protests in defense of public sector employees and unions in Wisconsin, how the U.S. deification of former President Ronald Reagan resembles North Korea, and the crackdown on political activists with anti-terror laws and FBI raids.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a67ad7c160b6b2623f7b5205669c8ebea1deb5","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+17+feb+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a67ad7c160b6b2623f7b5205669c8ebea1deb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,166,122,215,193,96,182,178,98,63,123,82,5,102,156,142,190,161,222,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
