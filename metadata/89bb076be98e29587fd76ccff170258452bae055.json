Owens is much less famous than James, but he's often compared to Skip due to his high, rich vocals and intricate guitar styles, which finds him using several tunings and occasional minor keys. His material, it must be noted, is not nearly as strong or tightly constructed as James', although it draws from some of the same sources. Noted folklorist and blues scholar David Evans made several recordings with Owens in the late '60s and early '70s.\n\n\nthis is a must have; this album is legendary...so what are you waiting for?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89bb076be98e29587fd76ccff170258452bae055","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Jack+Owens+%26+Eugene+Powell+-+Last+Giants+Of+Mississippi+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89bb076be98e29587fd76ccff170258452bae055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,187,7,107,233,142,41,88,127,215,108,207,241,112,37,132,82,186,224,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
