Yes, it\\'s the same rom selection. No, it\\'s not for 99 minutes CD-Rs. You aren\\'t dreaming. This disc will fit on a standard 80 minutes CD-R. I\\'ve taken the roms from the other disc, grabbed the builder and built a new disc, with a modified skin (this one is grey, much nicer than the red one, and with a new splash screen). It has most of the in game screenshots, NSFs, box scans, tittle shots, cart scans and more, but i haven\\'t included the manuals in the disc (FYI, the manuals are BIG in size, they occupied a little less than the half of the entire disc), making it fit in a standard CD-R. Hell, the whole compilation is 450 MB in size. There\\'s still plenty of space in the disc. Note that the disc wasn\\'t dummied since this is a emulator and the loading times are inexistent, thus it wasn\\'t necessary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aed3807e78df6571882bbdca3a8695d378ca295","amp;dn":"Details+for+NesterDC+-+Special+Edition+full+w%2Fromset","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aed3807e78df6571882bbdca3a8695d378ca295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,237,56,7,231,141,246,87,24,130,187,220,163,168,105,93,55,140,162,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
