Yet as we discover the urban environment is totally dependant on the natural world. Over the three years of filming for Human Planet, the teams have spent time with over seventy different communities in countries across the planet. \nDespite seeing many different ways of living, there are some aspects of family life that remain the same whether you live in a tree house in West Papua , or a brick house in Bolton. These similarities became very clear when the urban team went to film on a rubbish dump in Kenya. Here on the Kibarani dump on the outskirts of Mombasa, Ali, Ashe and their family live and survive amongst the rubbish, and even here, just like anywhere on the planet, everything stops for a nice cup of tea!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8464fdae08c594928acfdc88a28227984edcfa","amp;dn":"Human.Planet.S01E08.BDRip.XviD-HAGGiS.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8464fdae08c594928acfdc88a28227984edcfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,132,100,253,174,8,197,148,146,138,207,220,136,162,130,39,152,78,220,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
