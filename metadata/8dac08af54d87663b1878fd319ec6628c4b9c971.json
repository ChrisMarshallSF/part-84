As 10.04 is long-team support I didn't want it to fall behind. This is an updated version, it's a bit bigger then what it was before (by 300 MB) because I didn't build this from scratch, I just updated the existing 10.04.1.2 image. As of Thursday, 10th February, this was fully updated. I have added TeamViewer 6 to the install. After talking to a few people it seems many people that use Pinguy OS have installed it on a friend's or family's PC. Having TeamViewer 6 pre-installed will help them to give support and maintain their installs.&quot; The new release has many more new features, so see the release announcement if you wish to learn more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dac08af54d87663b1878fd319ec6628c4b9c971","amp;dn":"Pinguy+OS+10.04.2+Revisted+x86-64+%5B64-Bit%5D+%5Bgeno7744%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dac08af54d87663b1878fd319ec6628c4b9c971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,172,8,175,84,216,118,99,177,135,143,211,25,236,102,40,196,185,201,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
