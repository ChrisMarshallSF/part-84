They hold a monopoly over mods and instaban a lot of poeple.\nThat being said, becareful with what you say on those forums. For gamers, they get hurt really easily.....fucking wimps.\n\nFirst I would like to say, none of these sounds were of my creation.\nThank you very much to the creators of the spell sounds included in this package. they are awesome!\n\n\nThis replaces spell sounds in oblivion to give each spell type and school a distinctive sound.\n\nI have taken the best replacer spell sounds and made a spell sound pack for mine and your convienience.\n\nThis pack includes the following spell sound replacers. NOTHING BUT THE SPELL SOUNDS HAVE BEEN REPLACED.\n\n\n- Agars Varied Spell Sounds\n\nI used this one as the base replacer because it is a complete replacer and not just a few spell sounds like\nthe others.\n\n- Better Spell Sounds\n\nI replaced any spell sounds I didnt like as much from Agars with some of the spell sounds here.\n\n- Audia Arcanum Sound Overhaul\n\nI only used the spell sounds included. I did the same thing with overwritting any spell\nsounds I didn't find as good.\n\n- Audia Arcanum Update\n\nI replaced one spell sound with this update.\n\n\nTo install this just extract to you oblivion/data folder, overwrite if promted.\n\nMy make also extract your 'Oblivion - Sounds.bsa' file using OBMM, replace the sounds, and repackage your Oblivion - Sounds.bsa file.\nThis method is only recommended for somewhat advanced modders.\n\nNow enjoy these sounds! All hail Mehrunes Dagon!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f66f626ee413f86fc411b33c9e21b5c81435c32","amp;dn":"Oblivion+Magic+Sounds+Replacer+COMPLETE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f66f626ee413f86fc411b33c9e21b5c81435c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,102,246,38,238,65,63,134,252,65,27,51,201,226,27,92,129,67,92,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
