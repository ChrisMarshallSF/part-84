Before anyone starts in i know this is freeware. It was modded by me and on my website because it is freeware.\n\nIt has came to my attention that a large majority of flight simmers do not fly multiplayer and therefore never has heard of SimGameIt or know what we do. This is just another channel for us to be able to provide our aircraft mods.\n\nIf you arent aware of us please check us out at http://www.simgameit.com\n\nWe are also on Facebook.\n\nAnd you can join us on our TeamSpeak 3 server. Info to connect on our website. \n\n\nWe play FSX of coarse and we play the Battlefield Series, currently playing BFBC2.\nOur clan tags are =DedMen=\n\n\n\nNOTE: Our plane mods are intended for fun not reality. No they arent the best thing to hit flightsim. These aircraft are for people that like to scream at mach 4 through the skies and have alot of fun. If you want realism this isnt for you. But if you want a break from realism like some pilots including myself then download, hold on, and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b1dd2734bc22a3fe8e28e2551e069f8019bad7","amp;dn":"FSX+SimGameIt+Mod+M-18A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b1dd2734bc22a3fe8e28e2551e069f8019bad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,177,221,39,52,188,34,163,254,142,40,226,85,30,6,159,128,25,186,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
