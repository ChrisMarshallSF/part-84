VERY informative to say the least.\n\nOnly thing is they should have released it as part two or thereabout.\nLike; why wait until now with the hardest evidence? Oh well..\n\nThis documentary is creepy, because it shines a light on the total ignorance on people professing to be &quot;enlightened&quot;, but good, because it really nails the matter once for all. Of course it focuses on USA, but the international implications are there, and even more so today than then..\n\nWELL worth the watch..\n\n - FPS: 29,970\n\n - Source compressor: Xvid 1.2.1\n\n - Source resolution: 640x480\n\n - Source aspect ratio: 1,333\n\n - Target size: 1400 MB\n\n - Audio: AC3\n\n\nVerifire,\n============\nE-mail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;addbc8dfc4cbc4dfc8c0ccc4c1edcac0ccc4c183cec2c0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nWebsite: blazefire.org\n\n\n&quot;Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e58dc015f0cff35c0a1f21d70c261a259fe7185","amp;dn":"Hidden+Faith+of+The+Founding+Fathers+-+Secret+mysteries+of+Am%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e58dc015f0cff35c0a1f21d70c261a259fe7185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,88,220,1,95,12,255,53,192,161,242,29,112,194,97,162,89,254,113,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
