This movie doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need a review to know what it offers. As the posters and promos suggest, it is an out and out masala fare targeted at frontbenchers. \n    \nFew songs, fights, comedy and beautiful girls and duel role playing hero sums up Singam Puli for you. Director Sai Ramani came up with an age old twin brothers story and made it with a screenplay which is as old as Himalayas. Despite the clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©d storyline, Singam Pui might have been an engaging ride had the director taken good care about the screenplay. \n    \nThere are lots of holes left in the plot and none of the so called commercial elements were blended perfectly with the flow of the movie thus making Singam Puli a painful watch. Jiiva played his part superbly and the heroines Ramya Nambeesan and Honey Rose didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have much to do. \n    \nIf you are looking for some masala filled movie without any logic or seriousness, Singam Puli is just for you. Others could safely stay away from it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;    mastitorrents  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****check out my other releases****\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tdkdemon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/tdkdemon/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscreen shots:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/D8VC2Z.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/D8VC2Z.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/B8SF76.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/B8SF76.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/1D5RZV.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/1D5RZV.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f570643f959525552b2f8ed796a3a59f8777089b","amp;dn":"singam+puli+%5Btamil.movie.2011%5D.camrip.demon.mastitorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f570643f959525552b2f8ed796a3a59f8777089b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,112,100,63,149,149,37,85,43,47,142,215,150,163,165,159,135,119,8,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
