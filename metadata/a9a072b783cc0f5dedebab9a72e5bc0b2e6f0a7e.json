When an artist paints a portrait of Dorian to catch the full power of his youthful beauty, Dorian swears he would give anything to stay as he is in the picture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even his soul. DorianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stunning good looks and charm soon attract the celebrity lifestyle and everything that it brings, and he finds himself slipping deeper and deeper into a world of sin, sex and violence, seemingly without any consequences.
