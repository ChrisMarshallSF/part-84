Six episodes were broadcasted in 1989 as part of\nthe youth segment called Unga TvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥an on Sveriges Television\n(SVT). It was a mixture of education and entertainment,\nwhere each episode had competitions in games and demos, and\nusually an educational clip and examples of CGI-animation.\nThere was a slightly confused hostess (Gila Bergqvist) and\nan animated co-host called Orcon (sp?). Orcon would slightly\nchange his voice, personality and role inbetween the\nepisodes. John Minson was a British journalist who did\nexclusive reports from the UK. The last episode was hosted\nby Jan Trolin.\n\nBit fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r Bit was the first, if not only, TV-show that brought\nthe demoscene into the public eye on a frequent basis. They\ndisplayed demos as backdrop to the hostess, showing unedited\nscrolltexts with greetings, fuckings and so on. Each episode\nshowed a collage of Amiga demos, supposedly sent in by the\ndemo groups, and in the following episode a winner was\nannounced. The winner was selected by a jury. Several famous\ndemoscene groups appeared: Fairlight, Rebels, Defjam,\nKefrens, Phenomena, Byterapers, etc. In E01 and E02 the\nvertical synchronization was off, so the demos were displayed\nwrong. The end credits was a part from a Phenomena megademo,\nwith the song Let's Party by Firefox.\n\nEvery episode had a gaming competition called &quot;teledataspelet.&quot;\nThe games played were GeeBee Air Rally, California Games, \nPaperboy and RVF Honda. They were played using the phone as\na joystick. The beeps of the phone accompanied the sound of\nthe game, and the commentry of the hostess.\n\nThere were examples of CGI-animation in most episodes. Just\nlike the demos and games they were badly credited but they\nwere made by for example John Lasseter and Jeff Minter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:875a9b3ce522d6b1ddedae98009e6d431bcef720","amp;dn":"Bit.For.Bit.Complete.MP4-MEGABOYS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"875a9b3ce522d6b1ddedae98009e6d431bcef720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,90,155,60,229,34,214,177,221,237,174,152,0,158,109,67,27,206,247,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
