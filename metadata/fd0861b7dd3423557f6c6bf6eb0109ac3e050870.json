When CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) uncovers evidence indicating that a major terrorist leader may be operating out of Jordan, he enlists the aid of CIA veteran Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) in infiltrating the elusive saboteur's vast underground network. During the course of his dangerous mission, Ferris gradually comes to question how much he can trust his presumed allies -- who include not just Hoffman, but the outwardly helpful head of Jordanian intelligence as well. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd0861b7dd3423557f6c6bf6eb0109ac3e050870","amp;dn":"Body+Of+Lies%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd0861b7dd3423557f6c6bf6eb0109ac3e050870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,8,97,183,221,52,35,85,127,108,107,246,235,1,9,172,62,5,8,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
