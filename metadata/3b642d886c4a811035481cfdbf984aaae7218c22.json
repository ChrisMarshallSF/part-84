This group of musicians had previously worked together as a unit -- albeit not under the Little Village name - recording the John Hiatt solo album, Bring The Family in 1987.\nUpon reconvening in 1992, the group's name was initially (and jokingly) announced as Hiatus. It was soon changed to Little Village in reference to a famous, foul-mouthed in-studio diatribe by Sonny Boy Williamson II on a Chess reissue album titled Bummer Road.\nLittle Village recorded their first and last proper group album in mid-1992. The self-titled record featured a set of songs composed by all four group members. The songs were largely sung by Hiatt, although Lowe took lead on two songs and Cooder one.\nPrior to its release, the Little Village album was heavily anticipated in some quarters. Bring The Family was (and still is) considered to be one of Hiatt's finest albums, and a reunion of the group that recorded it fostered great critical expectations. However, upon being issued Little Village met with only lukewarm reviews and general commercial indifference. The consensus was that the material on the album seemed somewhat thin, as if the composers were saving their best work for their solo careers. Nevertheless, the album was nominated in 1993 for a Grammy Award as Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or a Group.\nThe Little Village album release was followed by a number of well-received concerts in the U.S. and Europe. Nevertheless, the group disbanded in late 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nRy Cooder (guitar, vocal), \nJohn Hiatt (guitar, piano, vocal), \nNick Lowe (bass, vocal) \nJim Keltner (drums).\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1 Solar Sex Panel 3:46\n2 The Action 3:25\n3 Inside Job 4:16\n4 Big Love 6:25\n5 Take Another Look 3:40\n6 Do You Want My Job 5:36\n7 Don't Go Away Mad 3:39\n8 Fool Who Knows 3:46\n9 She Runs Hot 3:18\n10 Don't Think About Her When You're Trying To Drive 4:32\n11 Don't Bug Me When I'm Working 3:56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b642d886c4a811035481cfdbf984aaae7218c22","amp;dn":"Little+Village+-+Little+Village++%5B1992%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b642d886c4a811035481cfdbf984aaae7218c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,100,45,136,108,74,129,16,53,72,28,253,191,152,74,170,231,33,140,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
