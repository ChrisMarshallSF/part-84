He predicts that silver's price will soon be steady. Regarding gold, he says it is still the best investment and as long as the dollar is weak purchasing gold is advised. He believes the dollar will continue to be weak because of the massive amount of dollars in the market. He also predicts that the price of oil will keep rising.\n\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is extracted audio from the Press TV video.
