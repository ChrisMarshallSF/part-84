James. Will it reach 60mph? Richard plays with a Porsche - again. This time, the new 911 Turbo S Cabriolet, which he races against a VW Beetle. A race with a Top Gear twist... Jeremy drives a paractical car that you can afford - the Skoda Yeti. And puts it through some rather unusual tests. John Bishop is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4174926d0a95508089d20b7b2c0d88af07bf3580","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+S16E01+-+Ipod%2FZune%2FPSP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4174926d0a95508089d20b7b2c0d88af07bf3580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,116,146,109,10,149,80,128,137,210,11,123,44,13,136,175,7,191,53,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
