And according to recent studies, in just 10 years nearly half the Peruvian rainforestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the most biologically diverse areas on EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“may be past the point of no return if current rates of deforestation continue. In [i]The Real Avatar[/i], David Suzuki sets off for the Amazon to investigate the effect this rush is having on the native peoples who call this land their home.\n\nUnder the shadow of the Cordillera del Condor mountains, and near where the mighty Amazon river begins, live the Awajun and Wampis peoples, a proud, warrior nation, never conquered by the Incas or the Spanish. Today, they feel they are being invaded again: Peruvian and Canadian mining companies aim to set up a gold mine on land these natives say is their traditional territory. In fact, the Awajun had an agreement for the establishment of a National Park along the Cordillera that would protect their land. But the Awajun found their agreement broken, quite literally in two, when Peru's President gave half the area over to mining interests. Studies indicate that mining here would devastate the area's water system ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ water that flows to the downstream Awajun communities.\n\nThe Awajun were already part of a deadly confrontation with National Police in 2009 over Peru's plans for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdevelopingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the Amazon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ can more violence be avoided in the future?\n\nIn the southern province of Madre de Dios, native peoples fought successfully for over a decade to establish a communal Reserve to protect their lands from illegal mining and logging. The Reserve created was so protected that not even the natives themselves were allowed to use it. And yet today, this same Reserve finds itself nearly totally engulfed by Oil Block 76, sold to the Hunt Oil Corporation of Texas. As Hunt's exploratory work begins, the natives find themselves divided. Some feel oil development will bring jobs and money, while others fear the social and environmental impacts, and know their very way of life is at risk.\n\nAnd for those nearby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUncontactedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ natives living in the forest in voluntary isolation, in the same way they have for thousands of years, the stakes are even higher.\n\nIn [i]The Real Avatar[/i], David Suzuki journeys to the Peruvian Amazon to see first-hand the forces threatening the way of life of its indigenous peoples, and to explore the magnificent beauty and richness of this now-vanishing land, this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPandoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on Earth.\n\nA dramatic story of cultures in conflict, with the fate of the Amazon hanging in the balance, [i]The Real Avatar[/i] is shot in full HD and is produced and directed by Roberto Verdecchia. \n\nEpisode webpage: [url]http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2011/peru/[/url]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]Technical Specs[/b]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- File Information ---\n\nFile Name.................: The Nature of Things.S50E14.The Real Avatar.03.Mar.2011.PDTV.XviD.theEmpire-philthy.avi\nDuration (hh:mm:ss).......: 45:02.860\nFile Size (in bytes)......: 366,024,704\n\n--- Container Information ---\nBase Type.................: AVI(.AVI)\n\n--- Video Information ---\n\nVideo Codec Name..........: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Duration............: 45:02.860\nframe Width (pixels)......: 624\nframe Height (pixels).....: 352\nPixel Aspect Ratio........: 1.000\nDisplay Aspect Ratio......: 1.773\nframes Per Second.........: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate (kbps)......: 941\n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                      \nAudio Codec...............: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate.........: 48000 Hz\nAudio BitRate Type........: VBR\nAudio Channels............: 2\nAudio Bitrate(kbps).......: 128\n\n\n*** Thanks to original uploader [b]philthy at TheEmpire.bz[/b] ***\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]About the show[/b]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]CBC - The Nature of Things with David Suzuki[/b]\n\nCBC Television's longest running and multi-award-winning series, THE NATURE OF THINGS with David Suzuki, returns for a 50th season of exciting and thought-provoking television.
