The show is based on the adventures of Sterling Archer, a spy for ISIS, whose boss is also his mother and his ex-girlfriend is a fellow spy. Unlike Family Guy, American Dad or South Park, Archer is not based around a family, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about a secret agent who tries to hit up with as many chick as possible, drink as much as possible and does battle with bad guys. The show also has great voices: Jon Benjamin won an Emmy Award nomination for outstanding voice-over performance for his work as the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title character the voice of Archer. The second season of Archer will roll out on January 27th on FX and I cannot wait. English subtitles included. Enjoy :)\n\nSuave secret agent Sterling Archer is the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most dangerous spy, but political intrigue and global crises are nothing compared to the sexual tension and human resources crises at the intelligence agency where he works. Archer must deal with his over-bearing, over-sexed motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who is also his bossÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and his femme fatale ex-girlfriend who seems to be sleeping with everyone except him. Embezzlement, mind control, hangovers, and demented double crossingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all in a dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work in this outrageously raunchy comedy!\n\nAfter just a 10-episode debut season, Archer has gained critical exaltation, a fervid fan base and clear reverence within the television industry.\n\nXviD 23.976fps 624ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€352;432 : MP3 128 kbps : 140MB x 1 + 175MB x 10\n\nalso, I ripped three extras created by the Archer staff that are also very funny.\n\nEnjoy, don't forget to seed, and if you like it, go buy the DVDs[center][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979ef94080ca0bc0b96501e5d26da64cf7af949e","amp;dn":"Archer.2009.S01.DVDRip.XviD-OSiTV+%2B+EXTRAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979ef94080ca0bc0b96501e5d26da64cf7af949e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,158,249,64,128,202,11,192,185,101,1,229,210,109,166,76,247,175,148,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
