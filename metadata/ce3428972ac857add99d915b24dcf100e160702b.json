While it was a mild commercial success, the album was critically panned. While the original album bears the credit &quot;Produced by Ric Ocasek&quot;, individual tracks from this album that appear on various Cars compilations bear the credit &quot;Produced by Ric Ocasek and Greg Hawkes&quot;.\n\nThe Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the early New Wave music scene in the late 1970s. The band consisted of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The band originated from Boston, Massachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s.\n\nThe band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek has always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, telling one interviewer in 1997 &quot;I'm saying never and you can count on that.&quot;. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material.\n\nOn October 21, 2010, The Cars confirmed that they have reunited and are recording their first album in 23 years. Greg Hawkes will fill in on bass for Benjamin Orr, who died in 2000.
