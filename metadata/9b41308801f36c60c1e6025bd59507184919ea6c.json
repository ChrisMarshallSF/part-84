Harrison's intriguing ninth Hollows novel (after 2010's Black Magic Sanction) lives up to the earlier books, which established Harrison as \n\na major urban fantasy player. Witch and bounty hunter Rachel Morgan needs to get to her brother's wedding. This leads to an uneasy alliance with her elven \n\nfrenemy Trent Kalamack, who's being pushed toward Seattle by a quest. Meanwhile, Jenks the pixy is recovering from the loss of his wife, Matalina, and \n\nneeds distraction. The result: &quot;A witch, an elf, and a pixy on the Great American Road Trip&quot; through a landscape reworked by magic, facing down terrifying \n\nfoes en route. Elegant and taut as a gymnast's cartwheel, Harrison's polished prose drives a story that will have readers swerving in their seats every \n\ntime Rachel turns the wheel. \n\nFrom Booklist\n*Starred Review* The ninth Rachel Morgan novel finds our tough and feisty witch on a mission to get her shunning rescinded, which requires traveling to \n\nthe annual witch convention in San Francisco. But the coven doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want her to make her appointment, so theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve put her on the no fly list, which is why \n\nshe has to accept TrentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s offer of a cross-country car trip. The rich elf has his own reasons for traveling cross-country, telling Rachel and Ivy that he \n\nis on a traditional elf quest. Fans of the series will recognize that simply having Trent, Jenks, Ivy, and Rachel on a road trip is enough to make for a \n\ngood story, but that is merely the beginning of an action-packed tale that finds Rachel coming fully into her demon magic powers and reevaluating her \n\nlong-held impressions of Trent. Ending with hints of some major character developments and changes in RachelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life, this is an excellent entry that is \n\nguaranteed to satisfy HarrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legion of followers. (Should there be any overlap between Clint Eastwood and Kim Harrison fan clubs, that subset will \n\ncertainly enjoy HarrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s allusions here to EastwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pale Rider.) The Rachel Morgan series is fast becoming one of the hottest tickets in the urban-\n\nfantasy subgenre. --Jessica Moyer ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b41308801f36c60c1e6025bd59507184919ea6c","amp;dn":"Pale+Demon+-+Kim+Harrison+-+audiobook+tomfc2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b41308801f36c60c1e6025bd59507184919ea6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,65,48,136,1,243,108,96,193,230,2,91,213,149,7,24,73,25,234,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
