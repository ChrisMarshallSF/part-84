Cook believes that the current rise in oil prices is because many funds and investors have took out their capital from the dollar market and invested it in the oil market. He says if it was not for this matter the current price of oil would be no more than 50/60 dollars. He promotes a new market structure in which there is no middleman and producers and consumers are linked directly. He says in this system the middlemen turn into service providers and it benefits them in the sense that they do not risk their own capital. He claims that the idea of the Iranian Oil Bourse is his.\n\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is extracted audio from the Press TV video.
