(AC3 passthrough)\n\nEncoded with handbrake.\n\n\nEnglish subtitles included, can be enabled and disabled in your player (such as VLC).  I included the english subs because some of the actors have a thick accent and you may miss a line here or there.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nPLOT: \nIn war-torn Eastern Europe, a world-weary group of mercenaries discover a long-hidden secret in an abandoned WWII bunker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf8ef2456f0207a9c7e7e956b7fff60689c3a77","amp;dn":"Outpost+%282008%29+Dvd-rip+AC3+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf8ef2456f0207a9c7e7e956b7fff60689c3a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,248,239,36,86,240,32,122,156,126,126,149,107,127,255,96,104,156,58,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
