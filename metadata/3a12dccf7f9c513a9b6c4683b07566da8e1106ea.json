Dr. Nathan Conrad (Douglas) is a respected adolescent therapist faced with a nightmarish scenario when his young daughter (Skye McCole Bartusiak) is snatched by Koster (Sean Bean), a criminal with a talent for high-tech surveillance. Conrad learns that the kidnapper is desperate for a critical piece of information known only to Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), one of his catatonic pro bono patients. While his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) remains at home, bedridden due to a broken leg, Conrad races to unlock the secret stored in Elisabeth's fractured mind, while a New York City detective (Jennifer Esposito) inches closer to discovering the Conrads' dilemma. Don't Say a Word co-stars Oliver Platt and Guy Torry and is directed by Gary Fleder, who follows up his suspense smash Kiss the Girls (1997). \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 53 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a12dccf7f9c513a9b6c4683b07566da8e1106ea","amp;dn":"Don%5C%27t+Say+A+Word%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a12dccf7f9c513a9b6c4683b07566da8e1106ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,18,220,207,127,156,81,58,155,108,70,131,176,117,102,218,142,17,6,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
