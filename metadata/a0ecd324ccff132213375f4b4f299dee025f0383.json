This version of the album found the track &quot;We're an American Band&quot; replacing &quot;Six String Fever&quot; as track 6. The singles released off the album were That's The Stuff and Blondes In Black Cars.\n\nA remastered version of the original album (red cover) was released by Spitfire Records in 2002, which retained the same track listing as the original, apart from the substitution of &quot;Six String Fever&quot; with a cover of Grand Funk Railroad's &quot;We're an American Band&quot; as track #6.\n\nAutograph was an American hard rock band from Los Angeles, California. Active on RCA from 1984 to 1989, they sold 1.5 million records and were awarded gold with their &quot;Sign In Please&quot; album. A new version of the band (v2.02) was formed \nby their founder Steve Plunkett in 2002 for a single album. They have been inactive since 2005.\n\nThey have toured with Motley Crue, Heart, Aerosmith, Ronnie James Dio, Van Halen, Bryan Adams, and Whitesnake.\n(video has a red/white &quot;vh1 classic&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_the_Stuff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_the_Stuff&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JADJiaaDi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JADJiaaDi&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 5999kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 2 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:15\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
