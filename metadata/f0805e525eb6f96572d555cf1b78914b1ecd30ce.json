Written by Mike Walker; Directed by Marc Beeby.\n\nWhen five lost souls, recruited by the Company travel to an abandoned planet, all they know is that they are to retrieve the only known sample of an ore left over from an old mining operation. But their task becomes considerably more complicated when one of their party has a close encounter with the indigenous plant life - plant life which seems to have some very odd, very powerful properties. Soon they are battling not only to stay alive, but to hang on to the very things that make them human.\n\nCally ... Nicola Miles-Wilden\nIntaba ... Cyril Nri\nHudson ... Clare Perkins\nJD ... Alex Tregear\nHussam ... Adeel Akhtar\n\nSound design by Pete Ringrose and Colin Guthrie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0805e525eb6f96572d555cf1b78914b1ecd30ce","amp;dn":"Mike+Walker+-+Landfall+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0805e525eb6f96572d555cf1b78914b1ecd30ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,128,94,82,94,182,249,101,114,213,85,207,27,120,145,75,30,205,48,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
