ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attractive and modern and it makes the program faster, easier and more fun to use than ever before. Everything is easy to find and he program guides you through all operations, with clear explanations on every step of the way.\n\nMost users will never have to consult the help ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all the information you need is displayed in the program itself where you need it and when you need it. \nFour new Windows maintenance tools\nIn addition to uninstalling programs, Ashampoo UnInstaller 3 now comes with over a dozen easy-to-use tools for keeping your Windows system clean and snappy. The following four tools are new: \nManage Restore Points\n \nWindows XP and later can create backups called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrestore pointsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that enable you to return your system to a previous state without losing any personal data (text documents, email messages, browser history and so on). This new tool makes using restore points easy. You can switch automatic restore points on and off, create restore points manually and load restore points to return your system to an earlier state. \nDefragment Hard Drives\n \nKeeping your hard drive defragmented speeds up Windows and can help to prevent errors. This new module uses AshampooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widely-praised defragmentation technology to keep your drives tidy so they deliver maximum performance. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fast, reliable and easy to use. Just select the drive and go, and you can interrupt or abort the process safely at any time. \nRegistry Cleaner\n \nThe Registry is the database where Windows and application programs store most of their settings. This is one of the main places where junk from partially-uninstalled programs collects and clogs up your system. The Registry Cleaner finds and deletes this garbage, including the junk left by programs removed before you started using Ashampoo UnInstaller. \nCheck Installed Programs Entries\n \nSometimes you will find entries for programs that no longer exist in Add/Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel. This new module finds and allows you to delete these orphaned entries, including the ones that are not even displayed but are still wasting space and resources on your system. \nOther new functions and improvements\nIn addition to all the improvements in the main program functions several of the other tools have also been updated: \nInternet Cleaner\n \nThis tool deletes all traces of your browsing activities and your browserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s temporary Internet files (copies of everything you have viewed online). You can also view and delete cookies (little data files for tracking and settings) that sites you have visited have stored on your hard drive. The new version now supports Firefox as well as Internet Explorer and finds more browsing data. \nNo more Easy/Expert mode switch\n \nThe program is now so user-friendly that there is no more need to switch between beginnersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and expertsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ modes. Experienced users still have full access to all the powerful functions they need. \nManage Fonts\n \nBy popular demand the Manage Fonts tool that was removed in version 2 has been reinstated. You can view all the fonts installed on your system along with all the specifications information for each font and remove any fonts you no longer need. \nStep-by-Step Assistant update\n \nThe popular Step-by-Step assistant that guides you through installing and uninstalling programs has been updated and is now even easier to use. \nStandard features and functions\nOf course the new version also includes everything that has made Ashampoo UnInstaller so popular with savvy Windows users ever since the first version: \nInstallation Monitor\n \nA taskbar program that automatically activates when you install a new program and logs the installation so that you can remove it completely with Ashampoo UnInstaller later. \nReinstaller\n \nChanged your mind about removing a program? The Reinstaller restores the removed installation in seconds ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to waste your time going through the entire complex installation procedure again. \nDrag &amp; Drop Desktop Uninstaller\n \nGet rid of programs fast by dragging them onto the UnInstaller icon on the deskop. Great for programs you were just testing. \nWindows management tools\n \nIn addition to the four new tools, Ashampoo UnInstaller 3 also comes with Internet Cleaner, Find/Delete Duplicate Files, Find/Delete Temporary Files, Find/Delete Empty Folders, Start Menu Cleaner (locate invalid entries in the Windows Start menu), Manage Windows Services (display, activate and deactivate Windows services), Manage Internet Explorer Add-Ons and File Backup (make backups of files and folders). \nMonitor program activity\n \nIn addition to uninstalling programs you can also use Ashampoo UnInstaller to find out what programs have been doing on your computer. Take a snapshot before doing something and another one afterwards and UnInstaller will show you all the registry entries, files, file changes and other changes made by the program between the two points. \nFeatures at a glance\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new: \nBeautiful new design with scalable displays\nMuch more intuitive user interface\nImproved interactive guides\nFull Vista compatibility\nManage Restore Points\nHard Drive Defragmenter\nRegistry Cleaner\nCheck Installed Program Entries\nMore powerful Internet Cleaner with Firefox support\nManage Fonts tool included again\nBasic functions and features: \nMonitor program installation automatically and manually\nUninstall programs completely, without a trace\nUninstall programs not monitored by Ashampoo UnInstaller\nReinstaller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ reinstall programs you have uninstalled \nDrag &amp; Drop uninstaller\nFind/Delete Duplicate Files\nFind/Delete Temporary Files\nFind/Delete Empty Folders\nStart Menu Cleaner\nManage Windows Services\nManage Internet Explorer Add-Ons\nFile Backup\n\n===============================================================================\n\n1.
