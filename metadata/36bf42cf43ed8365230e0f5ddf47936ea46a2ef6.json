THEME FROM TEQUILA VAMPIRE MATINEE *\n\nThe much-anticipated sequel to &quot;Hangover Honeymoon&quot;, &quot;Tequila Vampire Matinee&quot; features more bloodsoaked tall tales about restless ghosts, stray dogs, lovesick vampires, singing bank robbers and other hellbound creatures of the night. Recorded at Quain's infamous Casa Bastard studio, &quot;Tequila Vampire Matinee&quot; is a 66-minute trip through the feverish imagination of Kevin Quain, a genre-smashing collision of raucous Tex-Mex, snappy rags and ambient country twang. Includes Thief of Dances, Picking Flowers, and Born A Dog. \n\n\n\nFeaturing Mad Bastards Bryden Baird, Jordan O'Connor, Gene Hardy, Joe Phillips, Shawn Santalucia, Raoul Bhaneja, Sam Ferrara, Craig Harley and Jesse Baird\n\nCover design by Ralph Alfonso.\nPhotography by Duncan Buchanan.\nRecorded at Casa Bastard February-June, 2000.\nMastered by Phil Demetro at The Lacquer Channel, Toronto\n\nProduced by Kevin Quain\n\nALL SONGS BY KEVIN QUAIN Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2000 (SOCAN )\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/12/02/kevin-quain/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36bf42cf43ed8365230e0f5ddf47936ea46a2ef6","amp;dn":"Kevin+Quain...Tequila+Vampire+Matinee%28200%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36bf42cf43ed8365230e0f5ddf47936ea46a2ef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,191,66,207,67,237,131,101,35,14,15,93,223,71,147,110,164,106,46,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
