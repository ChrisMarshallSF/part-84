After bartering with a local land owner for a place to set up camp, they spend the night reminiscing over their wasted youth. The following morning they spot an ominous looking caravan, and decide to investigate. Within minutes, an idiotic prank leads to a series of brutal events and a deadly race for survival. A modern plunge back into the worlds created by movies such as 'Deliverance' and 'Southern Comfort' but with a gritty British twang. Kidnap, murder and a hidden past are just some of the reasons these four adventurers should have stayed at home. An action thriller that will make you question who the villains really are. You cant outrun what's in your blood.  \nGenre: Thriller\nLanguage: English\n\nCast:\nShane Sweeney ... Chris Hughes\nTom Geoffrey ... Andy Baxtor\nAlex Edwards ... Dan Marsden\nCelia Muir ...
