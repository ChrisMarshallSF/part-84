An Irwin Allen production (marking his final TV movie), it was a two-part special made for television and used a huge all-star cast of notable actors and actresses. The role of Alice was played by Natalie Gregory (replacing Heather O'Rourke, who originally won the part, but later turned it down because of a salary dispute). Alice in Wonderland was first telecast December 9, 1985, (part one) and December 10, 1985 (part two), at 8:00pm EST on CBS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc4f2661fb463f851da55c0e663e349f4fa11ff","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Wonderland+1985+part+1+of+2+Alices+Adventures+in+Wonder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc4f2661fb463f851da55c0e663e349f4fa11ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,196,242,102,31,180,99,248,81,218,85,192,230,99,227,73,244,250,17,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
