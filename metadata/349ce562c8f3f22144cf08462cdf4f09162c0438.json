Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962).\n\nThe Hulk is cast as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and reserved physicist Dr. Bruce Banner. The Hulk appears shortly after Banner is accidentally exposed to the blast of a test detonation of a gamma bomb he invented. Subsequently, Banner will involuntarily transform into the Hulk, depicted as a giant, raging, humanoid monster, leading to extreme complications in Banner's life. Lee said the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein.\n\nAll files sourced from the Complete Marvel Chronology Project, courtesy of PeteThePIPster.\n\nAll files are named with year and month of release, if you put my packs in the same folder you will automatically have a chronological collection.\n\nTAKING REQUESTS: PM your Marvel requests to drknark at\n\nFormat: CBR\nPublisher: Marvel\nRelease Dates: Apr 1999 - Jan 2008\nIssues:\nHulk #Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ - #11\nHulk Annual 1999\nIncredible Hulk v3 #12 - #111\nIncredible Hulk v3 Annuals 2000 &amp; 2001\nSentry &amp; The Hulk, Hulk Smash #1-#2\nHulk Smash #1-#2\nWolverine Hulk #1-#4\nHulk - The End\nHulk &amp; Wolverine 6 Hours #1-#4\nHulk Nightmerica #1-#6\nHulk - Gray #1-#6\nHulk Unchained #1-#3\nHulk Thing Hard Knocks #1-#4\nHulk Destruction #1-#4\nGiant Size Hulk #1\nWorld War Hulk Prologue Worldbreaker\nWorld War Hulk Frontline #1-#6\nWorld War Hulk X-Men #1-#3\nWorld War Hulk #1-#5\nWorld War Hulk Gamma Corps #1-#4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:349ce562c8f3f22144cf08462cdf4f09162c0438","amp;dn":"Hulk+Apr-99+-+Jan-08+Chrono+%5Bdrknark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"349ce562c8f3f22144cf08462cdf4f09162c0438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,156,229,98,200,243,242,33,68,207,8,70,44,223,79,9,22,44,4,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
