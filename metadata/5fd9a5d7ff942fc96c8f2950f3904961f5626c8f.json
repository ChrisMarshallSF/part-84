After a very public slow start, The Tourist went on to gross US$ 258 million worldwide.[2] The film was nominated for three Golden Globes, with a debate arising over the question if it was a comedy or a drama. Donnersmarck repeatedly stated it was neither genre, calling it &quot;a travel romance with thriller elements&quot;, but that if he had to choose between the two, he would choose comedy.[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd9a5d7ff942fc96c8f2950f3904961f5626c8f","amp;dn":"The+Tourist.2010.TS.Paul+Sutton+Fraudster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd9a5d7ff942fc96c8f2950f3904961f5626c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,217,165,215,255,148,47,201,108,143,41,80,243,144,73,97,245,98,108,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
