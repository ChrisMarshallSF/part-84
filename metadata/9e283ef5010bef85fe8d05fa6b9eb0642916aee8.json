Thanks to a powerful desktop client and mobile applications designed for iPhone, iPod touch, and Palm devices, 1Password gives you a more secure, convenient online experience no matter where you are.\nTake a look at the many ways 1Password can become an indispensable tool for harnessing all your passwords, identity, and personal information.\n\n* Automatically Save and Fill Website Logins\n\n* True Integration With Web Browsers\n\n* Support for Popular Web Browsers\n\n* Strong Password Generator\n\n* Rock Solid Security\n\n* Securely Organize Your Life With Wallet\n\n* Automatically Fill Credit Cards While Shopping Online\n\n* Automatically Fill Addresses, Contact Information, Forums, and More\n\n* Password History\n\n* Secure Notes\n\n* Stay Organized\n\n* Access Your Data Anywhere\n\n* Automatically Keep Your Data in Sync Between Macs\n\t\t\nFeatures:\n\nAutomatically Save and Fill Website Logins\n\n1Password allows you to quickly save new Logins from within every browser it supports.

Many applications provide safe storage areas for your private web information, but you often need to add your data by hand, then manually copy it back out when the time calls. We knew there had to be a better way.\n\nTrue Integration With Web Browsers\n\n1Password offers what no one else does: true web browser integration. Many applications provide safe storage areas for your private web information, but you often need to add your data by hand, then manually copy it back out when the time calls. We knew there had to be a better way.\n\n Support for Popular Web Browsers\n\nThe password, identity, and personal information tools that come pre-bundled with web browsers are specific to their exclusive playgrounds. Your data is locked up in each browser, forcing you to find a way to migrate your passwordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even possibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½every time you switch browsers. With 1Password, your information travels with you.\n\nStrong Password Generator\n\nLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face it: the days of using your petÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name or your anniversary as a password are long gone. While 1Password remembers all your passwords so you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to, it also has a great tool called the Strong Password Generator for creating really strong, un-guessable passwords to keep you safe online.\n\nRock Solid Security\n\nAll of your confidential information is encrypted using AES, the same state-of-the-art encryption algorithm used as the national standard in the United States (Fun fact: AES stands for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAdvanced Encryption StandardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). 1Password uses 128-bit keys for encryption, which means it would take millions of years for a criminal to decrypt your data using a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbrute forceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ attack.\n\nSecurely Organize Your Life With Wallet\n\nThe Wallet provides a secure place to store sensitive information like credit cards, bank accounts, memberships and reward programs, etc. You can use 1PasswordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powerful encryption technology to safely save all this information and find it when you need it.\n\nAutomatically Fill Credit Cards While Shopping Online\n\nShop more conveniently and keep your credit card numbers out of business hands by saving them locally in 1PasswordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wallet, then filling them into shopping forms when you want.\n\nAutomatically Fill Addresses, Contact Information, Forums, and More\n\nIn addition to credit card numbers, 1Password allows you to automatically fill even more things like your address, contact information, favorite links, and forum registrations with just a single click. You can save all or some of this information in a 1Password Identity, and you can create as many Identities as you like.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) or Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and supports most modern web browsers.\n\n-- PLEASE SEED --\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e283ef5010bef85fe8d05fa6b9eb0642916aee8","amp;dn":"1Password+3.5.8+%28Build+30881%29+%2B+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e283ef5010bef85fe8d05fa6b9eb0642916aee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,40,62,245,1,11,239,133,254,141,5,250,107,158,176,100,41,22,174,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
