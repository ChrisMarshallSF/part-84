You add stamps for the web site you want to add &quot;stuff&quot; to , the add the &quot;stuff&quot; and then click deliver.  The only problem I had with this program is that it's kind of slow, but it does work, and shows you a destination path from where your sending to where it's going. pretty cool..\n\nOfficial Web Site: &lt;a href=&quot; http://realmacsoftware.com/courier/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://realmacsoftware.com/courier/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBrains &amp; Beauty\n\nThe program is simple to usa.

While designing Courier we thought it'd be far more fun to show where your files are actually going - so each upload is plotted on a map with the route showing a progress bar that fills as the files are uploaded.\nOnce everything's been uploaded, Courier ensures handy links to the published files are ready for use and we even keep the history of all uploads so you can easily retrieve links to each file.\n\nCome in, We're open!\n\nThe Real mac Add ons area lists all of the awesome third-party add ons available for Courier. From unloaders for Box.net, CloudApp and Twitpic, to sylish new envelope designs, they're all available in the Add ons area!\nIf you're an Objective-C wizard, and there's no stamp for the service you want to upload to - there's a Cocoa plugin API that allows you to build your own stamps. We've created a sample plugin for developers to take a look at, which is now available on GitHub!\n\nVisit: &lt;a href=&quot; http://support.realmacsoftware.com/kb/courier/getting-started-with-courier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://support.realmacsoftware.com/kb/courier/getting-started-with-courier&lt;/a&gt;\n\nif you are having difficulties\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X.6\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633c17a918f4c20d54780810c310357425e92713","amp;dn":"Courier+v1.1.2+%5BK%5Drack%5C%27d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633c17a918f4c20d54780810c310357425e92713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,60,23,169,24,244,194,13,84,120,8,16,195,16,53,116,37,233,39,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
