Roney comes across as a sideman and is not as forceful here as one would have hoped. Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams had all grown with time and this reunion has Hancock and Williams taking on more prominent leadership roles than in the earlier days. With the exception of the drummer's &quot;Elegy,&quot; all of the music &quot;(&quot;So What,&quot; &quot;RJ,&quot; &quot;Little One,&quot; &quot;Pinocchio,&quot; &quot;Eighty One&quot; and &quot;All Blues&quot;) was regularly performed by the quintet back in the '60s. In general this reunion is a success even if it contains no new revelations. It is particularly nice to hear Wayne Shorter in this setting again. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tQwest\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.So What (Live) 10:19\n02.RJ 4:06\n03.Little One 7:19\n04.Pinocchio 5:44\n05.Elegy 8:42\n06.Eighty One 7:31\n07.All Blues (Live) 15:14\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82df7187ca5fda461c928089f16e0913be57da83","amp;dn":"VA+-+A+Tribute+To+Miles+%281994%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82df7187ca5fda461c928089f16e0913be57da83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,223,113,135,202,95,218,70,28,146,128,137,241,110,9,19,190,87,218,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
