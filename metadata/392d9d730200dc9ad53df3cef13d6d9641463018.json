A politician, he is engaged in a heated gubernatorial race with the feisty Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole), a tough old bird who doesn't hesitate to play hardball with opponents. Unfortunately for her, things are looking good for Donnelly. Fortunately she finds his Achilles' heel with his young brother Mike Donnelly (Saturday Night Live alumnus Chris Farley), a fat slob gym teacher and hopeless imbecile who only wants to win his more successful sibling's respect. Unfortunately all he does is embarrass poor Al to death. In desperation, Al assigns the sardonic and prissy Steve Dodds (David Spade) to keep Mike under constant surveillance. The real trouble begins when Tracy's aids try to frame hapless Mike for arson. \n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392d9d730200dc9ad53df3cef13d6d9641463018","amp;dn":"Black+Sheep%281996%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392d9d730200dc9ad53df3cef13d6d9641463018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,45,157,115,2,0,220,154,213,61,243,206,241,61,109,150,65,70,48,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
