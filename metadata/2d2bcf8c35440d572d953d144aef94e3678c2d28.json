They all work on any tv, all you need is 3D glasses, in this case, the red and blue lens ones.\n\nI'll keep looking for more to add, so keep posted for a new torrent coming soon, hopefully.\n\n----------\nVideo List\n----------\n\nAlice in Wonderland 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014759/\n\nAvatar 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/\n\nFur of Flying (Loony Toons short) 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714841/\n\nPiranha 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464154/\n\nResident Evil; Afterlife 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220634/\n\nSaw 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477076/\n\nStep Up 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193631/\n\nToy Story 3D - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435761/\n\n----------\nVideo info\n----------\nAll videos are in .MP4 format except Toy Story, which is in .AVI format.  They should work with any and all players but if not, I highly recommend getting KMPlayer.  I use to play everything from .AVI to .MPEG to .MKV. To date, I haven't found a format it cannot play.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kmplayer.en.softonic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kmplayer.en.softonic.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWith so may customizable features, this player is great for laptops, desktops and netbooks with Windows or Mac installed, sorry Linux.\n\n----\nNOTE\n----\nIf any of the above imdb's refer to a movie in it's 3D context, it will usually be referring to it with the new 3D technology, these movies are Anaglyphic (red and cyan glasses) and not polarized.\n\nHope you guys enjoy this small collection, I'll also be uploading it toas well.  Happy sharing;\n\n- Creamuur","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d2bcf8c35440d572d953d144aef94e3678c2d28","amp;dn":"3D+Anaglyhp+Movie+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d2bcf8c35440d572d953d144aef94e3678c2d28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,43,207,140,53,68,13,87,45,149,61,20,74,239,148,227,103,140,45,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
