McCluskey's vocals are warm and engaging, strong at times, then dreamy then vulnerable. The instrumental mix is particularly imaginative, and includes guitar, piano, organ, strings and even slide guitar, whilst the rhythms include pop, country-rock and reggae. In between, there are exquisite atmospheric moments, little trip-hop infusions that add a special charm. Highlights of this album are It's Been Done, Love Is Stronger Than Death and Sleep On It but her exceptional voice makes even the weaker material an enjoyable listening experience.\n\nAngela McCluskey has a luxurious, pliant voice reminiscent of Beth Orton, Cyndi Lauper, and even Billie Holiday. Thanks largely to producer/multi-instrumentalist Nathan Larson from Shudder to Think, the debut from this Scottish singer-songwriter and former Wild Colonials vocalist is a sumptuous and diverse pop-soul album. Take the first tune, &quot;It's Been Done,&quot; which kicks off with a smooth down-tempo beat, sparse piano notes, and arpeggiated strings - just when you're ready for yet another Portishead ripoff, it changes. McClusky's rich voice enters, sounding more than a little like Macy Gray, and there's a bass line so buoyant and good you almost don't notice it, followed by some smart, strange slide guitar playing. Now get this; the bridge has organ and a ska beat - but the song totally works. It's the kind of tune that inspires daydreams of making a movie just to place it at the climax. Similar genre-morphing pleasures abound on Things We Do, a contemplative, bluesy, and occasionally brilliant solo debut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nAngela McCluskey - Vocals, backing vocals\nKevin March - Drums, percussion\nPer Sunding - Guitar, organ, bass, backing vocals\nNathan Larson - Bass, lap steel, guitar, keyboards, drum programming, percussion, vibraphone, drums\nPaul Cantelon - Piano, violin\nJason Moran - Piano\nJames MacDonald - Accordion\nRichard Fortus - Guitar\nBruce Martin - Mellotron, Wurlitzer\nJens Johansson - Drums\nClayton Doyle - Piano\nBengt Lagerberg - Drums\nJoan Wasser - Strings\nJulia Kent - Strings\nDave Eggar - Strings\nMax Moston - Strings \n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n  01.
