One to take her... one to love her - and one to kill her.&quot;\n\nShe is Jill McBain, an ex-New Orleans prostitute who has secretly married Brett McBain in a bid to become a respectable woman. They are the mysterious stranger Harmonica, the notorious yet sympathetic outlaw Cheyenne and the ruthless killer Frank, who has just murdered Brett McBain and his brood for standing in the way of Morton's trans-American railroad.\n\nNot just the best Spaghetti western nor one of the greatest westerns but also one of the greatest films period, Sergio Leone's masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West is a complex, multi-faceted film that remains as enjoyable on the tenth viewing as the first one.\n\nThe script, co-written by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone, can be appreciated as a deconstruction of the mythology of the west and the western in which Manifest Destiny, the coming of the railroad and the transformation of the desert into a garden mean the gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tterdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤mmerunggotterdammerung for superhuman figures like Frank, Cheyenne and Harmonica and the emergence of a new tamed, civilised and above all feminised world, as represented by Jill.\n\nThe direction can be taken as an essay in film form, Leone combining his earlier Dollars experiments in time and space with the idea of a composed film, developing his mise-en-scene around Ennio Morricone's pre-existing scratch score.\n\nJust as remarkable as Leone's success in this regard is that of Morricone. While he always seems to find a way to make the music fit the action, it's rare that a score can stand in its own regard as well as this one does. A near literal horse opera, it presents each character with their own distinctive leitmotif - the lush strings and soaring vocals of Edda Dell'Orso for Jill, Allessando Allessandroni's whining electric guitar for Frank and so on - to be combined and counterpointed with one another as the epic tale moves towards its denouement.\n\nAdd in perfectly pitched performances from the leads - Henry Fonda chillingly cast against type, Charles Bronson seemingly born to incarnate Harmonica - a fine ensemble cast of reliable supporting players like Woody Strode and Lionel Stander, John Ford's beloved Monument Valley locations, and the only thing one can really say is missing is the presence of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as Frank's gunmen at the start (Leone had wanted them to say goodbye to the Dollars films but, alas, Eastwood was unwilling to participate.)\n\nUnlike Frank, you don't have to wait &quot;until the moment of dying&quot; to know: Once Upon a Time in the West is a vital, must-see film. \n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Once Upon A Time In The West(1968)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Once Upon A Time In The West(1968)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 2.12 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 45mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 833 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 45mn\nBit rate                         : 1 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.236\nStream size                      : 1.73 GiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 45mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 378 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 383 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5898\n2/27/2011 6:46:05 PM\nmbam-log-2011-02-27 (18-46-05).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 14 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
