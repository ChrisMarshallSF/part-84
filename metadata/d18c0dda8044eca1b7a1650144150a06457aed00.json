It consists of Dylan's first eight studio albums in mono on nine compact discs, the album Blonde on Blonde being issued on two discs in its original vinyl format\n\nMono was the playback medium for most record players, car radios, and transistor radios during the 1960s. Stereo playback systems had been available since the late 1950s, but the equipment and the albums mixed to play on them were expensive, and the music industry continued to manufacture mono albums and singles through the decade. Monophonic as a format would not be discontinued in both the United States and the United Kingdom until approximately 1969. As stated in the liner notes by Marcus,\n\nThis box collects Bob Dylan's first eight 12-inch LPs...as most people heard them, as they were expected to be heard, and as most often they were meant to be heard: in mono.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d18c0dda8044eca1b7a1650144150a06457aed00","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+The+Original+Mono+Recordings+%5BFLAC%5D+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d18c0dda8044eca1b7a1650144150a06457aed00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,140,13,218,128,68,236,161,183,161,101,1,68,21,10,6,69,122,237,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
