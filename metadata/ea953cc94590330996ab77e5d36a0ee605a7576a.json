Without drivers you wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to print a document, read this webpage or connect to the Internet. All hardware elements in your PC, including your graphics and sound card, your motherboard, your hard disk, your modem or even your keyboard, come with drivers. Initially these may have come preinstalled with the operating system, or you may have installed them from the manufacturerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CD. However the manufacturers will since have improved these drivers by removing bugs and adding extra features or functionality. This means that unless you update your drivers regularly you may face any of a range of problems, from the relatively minor, such as hardware that seems buggy and poorly performing, to the more major such as hardware failures, conflicts and complete system crashes.\n\nFeatures\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Keep you hardware up to date with the very latest drivers\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Download drivers quickly and reliably from one centralized location\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Keep restore-points with each driver update for maximum safety\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Install each new driver quickly and with ease\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Enjoy an elegant but simple to use interface\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Update drivers for 32 or 64-bit systems running Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7\n\nRecommended system requirements\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Intel Pentium 4 1GHz or Equivalent\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 512MB RAM\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 200MB free hard disk space\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Internet Explorer 7\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows XP / Vista / 7\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Graphics mode 1024x768 true color (highest 32-bit)\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\n1.
