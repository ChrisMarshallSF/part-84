The group was initially composed of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, The Beach Boys signed to Capitol Records in 1962. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid 1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed Pet Sounds album and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that was a far cry from the simple surf rock of The Beach Boys' early years.\n\nHowever, Wilson would soon lose control of the band because of mental-health and substance-abuse issues. Subsequently, although it released a number of popular albums (in various musical styles, with different line-ups) in ensuing years, the group never managed to reclaim its mid-'60s peak when The Beach Boys briefly challenged The Beatles both in terms of commercial and critical appeal. Since the 1980s, there has been much legal-wrangling among the group members over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name. While The Beach Boys released their last studio album in 1996, a number of versions of the band, each fronted by a surviving member of the original quintet (Dennis and Carl Wilson died in 1983 and 1998, respectively), continue to tour.\n\nThe Beach Boys have often been called &quot;America's Band&quot;, and Allmusic has stated that &quot;the band's unerring ability... made them America's first, best rock band.&quot; The group has had 36 United States Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band) and 56 Hot 100 hits, including four number-one singles. Rolling Stone magazine listed The Beach Boys at number 12 on their 2004 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nBrian Wilson \nDennis Wilson\nCarl Wilson\nMike Love \nAl Jardine\nBruce Johnston\nRicky Fataar  \nBlondie Chaplin\nDavid Marks \nGlen Campbell \nDaryl Dragon \nToni Tennille\nCarli MuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±oz\nMike Meros\nMike Kowalski \nEd Carter \nBobby Figueroa \nJoe Chemay \nAdrian Baker  \nJeff Foskett\nJohn Renner\nRitchie Cannata\nBilly Hinsche\nMatt Jardine\nRandell Kirsch\nJohn Foster\nJohn Cowsill\nDean Torrence\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.I Get Around ( 2:15 )\n02.Help Me Rhonda ( 2:47 )\n03.California Girls ( 2:38 )\n04.Barbara Ann ( 2:06 )\n05.Sloop John B.
