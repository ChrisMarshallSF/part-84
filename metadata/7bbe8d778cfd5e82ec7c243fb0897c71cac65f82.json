Using your arsenal of plasma obliteration weapons your mission of mercy will involve mass beast-busting and alien annihilation as the battle rages through the city streets.\n\nCharacters\n----------\nGordon, a tough guy with a bazooka, has a special gunship attack, while Karla has a flamethrower for alien crisping - though she prefers to use her special ballistic missile attack. Finally, Slammer the robot can self-destruct at will and attacks the invaders with an electric whip, as well as other devices. Take the aliens by storm and save your city!\n\nGamplay\n-------\nA side-scrolling action arcade game, you can move in all directions while dodging \naad blasting the aliens.\n\n\nThe FPS sequences pop up fairly frequently, and shift the perspective behind your weapon as you blast aliens in enclosed areas like warehouses and convenience stores. The baddies hide behind stacks of boxes and cereal aisles, and then leap out at you (trying to strike the screen in the foreground). It\\'s reminiscent of other SEGA shooters, like Ghost Squad. Not a bad diversion in-between brawling stages. \n\nAnd the \\&quot;run-and-gun\\&quot; levels are scenes in which your character is constantly running forward, to the right side of the screen, in a forced-scrolling shooter kind of way. You can leap over enemies and change your position relative to the constantly-moving ground underneath your feet, but it\\'s mostly a game of dodging and blasting as more and more enemies pour into your range, begging to be blasted.\n\n\nScreenshots\n----------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as001_med.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as001_med.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as004_med.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as004_med.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as006_med.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as006_med.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as009_med.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sega.com/games/uploaded/screenshot_uploads/as009_med.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHow To Start The Game\n---------------------\n1.
