In addition to full multimedia support and custom artwork, it uses the lightweight LXDE desktop environment. This  makes it fast and well suited as a livecd OS for those who want to get speed out of their computers while preserving ease of use and keeping oppressive governments at bay.\n\nBeing based on PCLinuxOS, Apartheid is a rolling release. This means the OS is always changing and you will always get the latest applications without having to reinstall.\n\nMd5sum: 8bb3ba5d6dbbc0f415ab59c1ad89c8a3  apartheid.iso\n\nLogin: guest \nPassword: guest\nRootpassword: root\n\nAlternate download: http://www.woofiles.com/dl-236217-GRAgNYz4-apartheid.iso (Please do not use it unless the torrent is dead!)\n\nWhy use it?\n-Tor works out of the box!\n-Rolling release (like Arch or Debian testing/sid) but still very easy to use\n-A GUI for almost anything in the Control Center\n-Multimedia preinstalled.

Makes it well suited for use as a livecd or on computers with low specs.\n-Can be run from the cdrom or installed to the hard drive.\n-Easy to back up your own system with mylivecd script or installing the OS to a memory stick.\n\n\nApartheid comes with just a few basic applications:\n\n\nSoftware installed: \n\nbleachbit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ System Cleaning Program\nevince ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ PDF viewing Client\nfile-roller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Archiving Client\nfirefox- Web Browser (Chromium and Opera available from our software center)\nflash-player-plugin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Flash Support\ngimp ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Graphic Drawing Program\ngpicview ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Graphic Viewing Program\ngnomebaker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ CD/DVD Burning Program\nkernel-2.6.33.7-pclos6.bfs-1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BFS kernel for maximum desktop performance\nleafpad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Text Editor\nlxdecc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ LXDE Control Center\nlxmusic - Music Player\nliveusb ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Put PCLinuxOS on USB key disk (New on LiveCD)\nVLC- Video Player\nnano ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Console Text Editor\npcmanfm- File Manager\npidgin - Instant Messenger\nscreenie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Screenshot Program\nsearchmonkey - Desktop Search\n\n\n\n12,000 additional programs available from Synaptic Software Manager after installation to your computer.\n\n\nHardware requirements\n\nProcessor:\n\nModern Intel or AMD processor.\n\n\nMemory &amp; storage:\n\nRAM : 384 MB minimum, 1 GB recommended.\nHard disk : 3 GB minimum, 10 GB or more recommended if you plan to install additional software from our repository.\n\n\n\nThis only applies if you install Apartheid to your hard drive: \n\nApartheid uses the PCLinuxOS repositories, so whatever applies to PCLinuxOS, applies to Apartheid. The following is very important\n\nIf you get a question like this, &quot;Some packages could not be retrieved&quot; - &quot;Continue ignoring these programs ?&quot;, NEVER EVER answer Yes! If you get this message answer NO and then click APPLY again to restart the download.\n\nYou've downloaded the Apartheid Livecd, controlled the MD5sum, burned the image slowly and verified it with your burner \n\nAll your hardware works, and you install.\n\nEverything works sweetly and you want to keep it that way.\n\nFirst, do a full update of the system. Open Synaptic, click Reload, Mark All Updates, Apply, Apply.\n\nWait for it to completely finish.\n\nNow you can go to synaptic and install any applications that take your fancy.\n\nEvery few days open Synaptic, click Reload, Mark All Updates to see if there are any. If the Apply Tick remains inactive, there is none.\n\nOnly ever have ONE repository enabled. If the current repo is sluggish, uncheck that and choose another. Click Reload afterwards to get the correct package lists from that mirror.\n\nApartheid/PCLinuxOS is a 'meta' distro, or 'rolling release', that is, it is built in such a way that the user installs and then fully updates periodically over an indefinite period. (The last six years, users would have to reinstall only once.)\n\nThis means that a certain discipline is required of the user. It must adhere to program of fully updating from time to time and never installing outside packages in order to preserve the stability, thus reliability, of the system.\n\n\nHave fun!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd5ed3c7f3f9c9de92d3c80bd612d61fd1726d1e","amp;dn":"Apartheid.1.0.LXDE.i686.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd5ed3c7f3f9c9de92d3c80bd612d61fd1726d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,94,211,199,243,249,201,222,146,211,200,11,214,18,214,31,209,114,109,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
