The virus just disables when sony vegas asks for a serial and authentication code it disables it so that the serial number in the keygen works!\n\nNote: You will need winrar or a programme which can extract files. I recomend winrar!\n\nSimple steps:\n\n1.  Download this torrent\n\n2.  Extract it to your desktop\n\n3.

A little box with all of your files should appear\n\n6. go to programme files (x86 if your 64 bit like me or just programme files if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got 32 bit) Note: if you saved it somewhere else when you downloaded the Vegas trial then go to the place you saved it.\n\n7.  Click patch at the bottom of the box. Wait for a few seconds then go to where you saved vegas and double click it!\n\n8. do your setup and when it asks you for a serial go back to your keygen press \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;generate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; a few times then copy and paste the serial off the keygen to the sony vegas setup!\n\n9.
