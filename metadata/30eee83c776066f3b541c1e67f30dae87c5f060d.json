It was published in 1999 by GT Interactive. Retrospectively, the game has also been referred to as UT99 or UT Classic to differentiate it from its numbered sequels. The game is based on the same technology that powered Unreal, but the design of UT shifted the series\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' focus to competitive multiplayer action, a trend at the time: id Software\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Quake III Arena was released only ten days later.\n\n\nMinimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lis gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©pigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ny:\t\tAjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nlott gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©pigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ny:\nCPU:\tPentium III or AMD Athlon 1.0 GHz processor\t\tCPU:\tPentium IV or AMD Athlon 2.0 GHz processor\nRAM:\t128 MByte RAM\t\tRAM:\t512 MByte RAM\nVGA:\t32 MB Windows compatible video card*\t\tVGA:\tNVIDIA GeForce 4 or ATI Radeon Hardware T&amp;L card with 128 MB VRAM recommended\nDX:\tDirectX version 9.0b or higher\n\nDirectX is not required for using the software renderer\t\tDX:\tDirectX version 9.0b or higher\nOS:\tWindows 98/Me/2000/XP\t\tOS:\tWindows 98/Me/2000/XP &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gepigeny.hu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gepigeny.hu/&lt;/a&gt;\nHDD:\t6 GByte free\t\tHDD:\t6 GByte free\nHang:\tWindows compatible sound card.
