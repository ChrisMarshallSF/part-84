Directed by C.B. Harding (The Osbournes), The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Movie also incorporates behind-the-scenes segments with the individual comedians. Along the same lines as The Original Kings of Comedy, but marketed toward a radically different crowd, this comedy concert headlines the top names in so-called &quot;redneck&quot; humor: Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy. This film arrives after the four performers spent two years on the road and released the best-selling comedy record Blue Collar Comedy Tour Live. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb991ffe2618b5dc55745cf8c7c303ae125310ef","amp;dn":"Blue+Collar+Comedy+Tour%282003%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb991ffe2618b5dc55745cf8c7c303ae125310ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,153,31,254,38,24,181,220,85,116,92,248,199,195,3,174,18,83,16,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
