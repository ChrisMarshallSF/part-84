Discussions vary from how the hero of Crow was 'created by God's nightmare', to his views on his role as Poet Laureate. The horizons in Hughes's poems are creation and the infinite, while a dark malevolence and a 'legendary depth' lurk in simple things, like the thistles that bear the 'dark stain of a Viking'. In a letter to Sylvia Plath quoted in Alice Oswald's excellent introductory essay in the inlay booklet, Hughes says silent reading carries only 'one third the emotional charge' of a poem. These recordings, ranging from the visceral to the lyrical, present the full emotional voltage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53424a0475f02dc62901b2d811126bb32bf1edcc","amp;dn":"Ted+Hughes+Poetry+in+the+Making","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53424a0475f02dc62901b2d811126bb32bf1edcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,66,74,4,117,240,45,198,41,1,178,216,17,18,107,179,43,241,237,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
