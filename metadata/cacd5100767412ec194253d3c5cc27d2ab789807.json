Well, I got my answer: He proposed to freeze non-defense, discretionary spending for five years, which he claims would ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n$400 Billion sounds like a lotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦but thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spread out over ten years, so itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really more like $40 Billion per year. The CBO projects the average annual deficit over the next 10 years to be $768 Billion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nearly 20 times larger than that. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFiscal hawkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? More like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfiscal chickenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to have to cut a lot more than $40 Billion per year if weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to eliminate the deficit.\n\nSo, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just what IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll do on tonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s show (FBN @ 9pm &amp; midnight ET): IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll make the big spending cuts necessary to eliminate the deficit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cacd5100767412ec194253d3c5cc27d2ab789807","amp;dn":"20110127-Stossel-%5BBalancing+the+Budget%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cacd5100767412ec194253d3c5cc27d2ab789807","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,205,81,0,118,116,18,236,25,66,83,211,197,204,39,210,171,120,152,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
