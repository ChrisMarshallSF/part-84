In the United States, it was the third single from the album, and reached #76 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nHoward Jones (born John Howard Jones, 23 February 1955, Southampton, Hampshire, England) is a Welsh musician. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums, &quot;Jones is an accomplished singer-songwriter who was a regular chart visitor in the mid 1980s with his brand of synthpop. Jones, who was equally popular in the U.S., appeared at Live Aid&quot;. \n\nAllmusic journalist, Stephen Thomas Erlewine adds, &quot;Jones was one of the defining figures of mid 1980s synthpop. His music merged the technology intensive sound of new wave with the cheery optimism of hippies and late 1960s pop. Jones racked up a string of hits in the mid and late 1980s, before he retreated into being a cult figure in the 1990s&quot;.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Want_(Howard_Jones_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_I_Want_(Howard_Jones_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAdpNAaDj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAdpNAaDj&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9000kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 2 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:14\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
