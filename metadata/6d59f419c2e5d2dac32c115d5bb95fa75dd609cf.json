The album contains some of his major hits and several remixes up to this point. One notable track, &quot;Valerie&quot;, was originally released as a single for Winwood's 1982 album, Talking Back to the Night. Despite the original single being a commercial flop, a successful remix of the song is included in this album, peaking at #9 on the US charts.\n\nTrack listing All songs written by Steve Winwood and Will Jennings, unless otherwise noted.\n\n1.&quot;Wake Me Up On Judgment Day&quot; 5:47\n2.&quot;While You See a Chance&quot; 5:09\n3.&quot;Vacant Chair&quot; (Remix) (Steve Winwood, Vivian Stanshall) 6:49\n4.&quot;Help Me Angel&quot; (Remix) 4:57\n5.&quot;My Love's Leavin' &quot; (Steve Winwood, Vivian Stanshall) 5:19\n6.&quot;Valerie&quot; (Remix) 4:05\n7.&quot;Arc of a Diver&quot; (Steve Winwood, Vivian Stanshall) 5:28\n8.&quot;Higher Love&quot; 5:47\n9.&quot;Spanish Dancer&quot; 5:58\n10.&quot;Talking Back to the Night&quot; (Remix) 5:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d59f419c2e5d2dac32c115d5bb95fa75dd609cf","amp;dn":"Steve+Winwood+-+Chronicles+%281987%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d59f419c2e5d2dac32c115d5bb95fa75dd609cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,89,244,25,194,229,210,218,195,44,17,93,91,185,95,167,93,214,9,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
