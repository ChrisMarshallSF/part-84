A fourteen-year-old student, Dannie, feels \n\nthe real cause is linked to her recurring dreams. When the infection reaches an epidemic level. it becomes clear that this infection \n\nnot only kills, but restores the body to a minimally functioning state where the infected become the &quot;living-dead&quot;. This unique twist \n\non the classic zombie theme, centers around the highly-intuitive Dannie Jacobs and a group of four other middle school students who \n\ntry to save their friends, their town and themselves in spite of the odds against them. While they are desperately trying to find an \n\nanswer before it's too late, they meet researcher Sue who may hold the key to the infection and Dannie's dreams. \n\n\n\n\n\nZombie Girl  (2009)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1278480/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1278480/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEmily Hagins is making a zombie movie.
