Charles' big break came in 1975, when Indian-British music composer and record producer Biddu, who had just enjoyed massive success worldwide writing the disco hit &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; for Carl Douglas, produced the single &quot;I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)&quot; for her. The single spent three weeks at number one on the UK chart in March 1976, and was a major hit around the world. Biddu's collaboration continued on a future album and another song hit: &quot;Dance Little Lady Dance&quot;. In total, Charles spent 42 weeks on the UK Singles Chart in 1976 alone, mainly due to these two songs.Further hits like &quot;Love Me Like a Lover&quot;, &quot;Dr Love&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous&quot; and &quot;Love Bug&quot; made her a pop star throughout Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, but she was never able to achieve success in the US. Her only solo recording to chart significantly in the US was &quot;You Set My Heart on Fire,&quot; which reached number 3 on Record World's 'Disco File Top 20' chart in the autumn of 1975.\n     Baccara was a female vocal duo formed in 1977 by Spanish artists Mayte Mateos and Maria Mendiola. The pair rapidly achieved international success with their debut single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes Sir, I Can BoogieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which reached number one across much of Europe. A successful follow-up single (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSorry, I'm A LadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and European tour led to a number of album releases, numerous television appearances and the duo's selection to represent Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978.Most of Baccara's recordings were sung in English although they did also record in Spanish, German and French. They recorded different language versions of some songs. \n     Pussycat was a Dutch country and pop music group, driven by the three Kowalczyk sisters: Tonny, Betty and Marianne. Other members of the band were Lou Wille, Tonny's husband, Theo Wetzels, Theo Coumans and John Theunissen.In 1975 they scored a big European hit with the song &quot;Mississippi&quot;. However they had to wait a further year for the single to make the British charts when it climbed to number one in the UK Singles Chart in October 1976.Penned by Werner Theunissen, the septet became the first Dutch act to top the UK chart. It is estimated that &quot;Mississippi&quot; sold over five million copies worldwide. It was later followed by &quot;Smile&quot; in 1976, and &quot;Hey Joe&quot; in 1978. Others hits were &quot;If You Ever Come to Amsterdam&quot;, &quot;Georgie&quot;, &quot;Wet Day in September&quot; and &quot;My Broken Souvenirs&quot;. \n     Luv' is a Dutch pop girl group that scored a string of hit records in Continental Europe  as well as South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico in the late 1970s and early 1980s.. Among their greatest hits: U.O.Me (Welcome To Waldolala), You're the Greatest Lover, Trojan Horse, Casanova and Ooh, Yes I Do. Trojan Horse&quot;  was a #1 hit single in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. It reached the Top 5 in Austria, Switzerland and Germany, the Top 10 in New Zealand (where Luv' became a One-hit wonder), the Top 20 in South Africa and the Top 50 in France and Australia. \n\n             \n\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia          \n        ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21765b6bdeda3e8635ee214e136582ceb91b25d5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+284","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21765b6bdeda3e8635ee214e136582ceb91b25d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,118,91,107,222,218,62,134,53,238,33,78,19,101,130,206,185,27,37,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
