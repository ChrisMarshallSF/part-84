Released in 1978 with much fanfare, this spectacular, big-budget 'Motown' remake of The Wizard of Oz with America's best black actors, singers and comics, takes place in the neon-soaked streets of downtown New York. With spirited performances from superstars Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Richard Pryor and its fair share of lively Motown-styled musical numbers, Jackson's producer Quincy Jones augments the songs from the hit Broadway musical with a few tunes of his own. Highlights include &quot;The Emerald City Ballet&quot; routine and a rousing &quot;Everybody Rejoice&quot;.\n\n1. Main Title from &quot;The Wiz&quot; (Overture, Pt. 1)\n2. Overture, Pt. 2\n3.
