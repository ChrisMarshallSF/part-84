The pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, and the ratings of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. Originally, Kripke planned the series for three seasons, but later expanded it to five. The fifth season began airing on September 10, 2009, and concluded the series' main storyline; however, The CW officially renewed the show for a sixth season on February 16, 2010. Eric Kripke confirmed that he would not return as showrunner; however, he would stay on as a hands-on executive producer. Sera Gamble, replacing Kripke as showrunner, has stated that the sixth season will focus on the brothers' relationship and the secrets they discover.\n\n''Seed 'n' Breed''","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f300e837529f230be3f5840b03bbaf0eb69ac10","amp;dn":"Supernatural+%5BS01-S05%5D+%5BS06E01-E16%5D.avi+%5BWhiteDragon%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f300e837529f230be3f5840b03bbaf0eb69ac10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,48,14,131,117,41,242,48,190,63,88,64,176,59,186,240,235,105,172,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
