Their musical style is a blend of folk music, jazz and classical chamber music, with touches of blues. The music written by the members of the ensemble is often centred on an album theme and is played with a wide variety of acoustic instruments.\n\nThe name of the band is an original composition, coming from the English word 'flair' and the Dutch word 'vlerk', which means 'a nimble fingered hand' or 'wing', but also 'rowdy young man'.\n\n1.
