The narrative simulation system was designed and implemented by Greg Guerin and Ron Martinez (who also produced the game). The game was intended to simulate the conditions of a post-revolutionary Central American country. It is considered a forerunner of the Games for Change movement, alongside other early Macintosh games including Chris Crawford's Balance of Power and Balance of the Planet.\n\nThe game is set in the fictional country Chimerica which has been recently liberated from the rule of the corrupt dictator Farsante and his ruling clique. The player takes the part of the newly elected president of Chimerica.\n\n(wiki)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nanother all-time classic, this time from the late eighties :)\nI remember playing this on a monochrome IBM 8086 back in the days.../SgtS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39dcc7816e571c6849fb49be9e672cb140c79e7d","amp;dn":"Hidden+Agenda+%5Bdos%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39dcc7816e571c6849fb49be9e672cb140c79e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,220,199,129,110,87,28,104,73,251,73,190,158,103,44,177,64,199,158,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
