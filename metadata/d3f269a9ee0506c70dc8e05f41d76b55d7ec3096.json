Like fellow chillwavers, he sings wistfully over a blend of acoustic instruments and electronic programming, and uses a retro 80s palette of synth sounds. After the Be So True EP and Sunndreamm EP generated a buzz online in 2010, Diaz announced that his first full-length, Replicants, would become available in early 2011.\n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Electronic\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks:\n\n  1.
