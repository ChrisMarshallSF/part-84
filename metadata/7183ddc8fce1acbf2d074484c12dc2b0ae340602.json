At an interview before a panel of executives from her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, her testimony regarding the Alien is met with extreme\nskepticism as no physical evidence of the creature survived the destruction of the Nostromo. Ripley loses her space flight license as a result of her \\&quot;questionable judgment\\&quot; and learns that LV-426, the planet where her crew first encountered the Alien eggs, is now home to a terraforming colony.\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nEncode date: 26/1/2011\nFile size: 1.19GB\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\n\n\n\n::Video Specification::\nContainer: mkv(.avc)\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nNominal bit rate 977\nOverall bit rate: 1 106 Kbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nResolution: 740x320\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.172\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\n::Audio Specification::\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: aac\nBitrate: 448 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz,\nChannel Count: 2 channels\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/7025/aliensmkvsnapshot003451.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/7025/aliensmkvsnapshot003451.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/6148/aliensmkvsnapshot000249.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/6148/aliensmkvsnapshot000249.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlien 3\n\n\nStoryline: Following the events in Aliens, the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco experiences an onboard fire and launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop who are all in cryonic stasis. During the launch, the ship\\'s medical scans of the crew\\'s cryotubes show an Alien facehugger attached to one of the crewmembers. The pod thencrashes on Fiorina \\'Fury\\' 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates with \\&quot;double-Y\\&quot; chromosome patterns and histories of physical and sexual violence. After some inmates recover the pod and its passengers, an Alien facehugger is seen approaching the prison dog. Ripley is taken in and awakened by Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison doctor, and is told she is the only survivor of the crash. Many of the ex-inmates have embraced an apocalyptic, millenarian version of Christianity, and Ripley is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, (Brian Glover) that her presence among them may have extremely disruptive effects\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nEncode date: 27/1/2011\nFile size: 1.34GB\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103644/\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\n\n\n\n::Video Specification::\nContainer: mkv(avc)\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nNominal bit rate: 882 Kbps\nOverall bit rate 1 327 Kbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nResolution: 740x320\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.155\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\n::Audio Specification::\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: aac\nBitrate: 448 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/4955/alien3mkvsnapshot000951.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/4955/alien3mkvsnapshot000951.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/2884/alien3mkvsnapshot010050.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/2884/alien3mkvsnapshot010050.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlien Resurrection\n\nStoryline: Alien Resurrection takes place 200 years after Alien 3.
