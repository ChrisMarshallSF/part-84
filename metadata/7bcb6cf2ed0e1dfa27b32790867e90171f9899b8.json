He worked with Lonesome Sundown (and would do so again in the 1970s) and Lonnie Brooks. In the mid 1950s he had a spell in Clifton Chenier's band. He spent the 1960s in Los Angeles, California leading a band that played a catholic repertoire of the R&amp;B chart music, joined by his singing wife Ina, alias Bea Bopp. Singles furnished his album Bottom of the Top (Playboy, 1973), succeeded by sets for Joliet, Rounder, Hightone, JSP and Black Top.\n\nWalker was also known for his variety of styles and the changes he would often make for each album. Not until 1969 did he begin to record more regularly when he joined with producer Bruce Bromberg. Since then, fans had a more steady supply of Walker's music.\n\nHe appeared on show 237 of the WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour in 2002 when Live at Biscuits &amp; Blues had just been released.\n\nWalker's final studio release is Going Back Home (2007) on Delta Groove Productions.\n\n\nMmmm...not bad...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bcb6cf2ed0e1dfa27b32790867e90171f9899b8","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Phillip+Walker+-+Going+Back+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bcb6cf2ed0e1dfa27b32790867e90171f9899b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,203,108,242,237,14,29,250,39,179,39,144,134,126,144,23,31,152,153,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
