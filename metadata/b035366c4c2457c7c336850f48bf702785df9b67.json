Since this one is very hard to find, I decided to upload it to share it with Steve Miller Band fans. It has been ripped from vinyl by an unknown person in FLAC format. I listened to it on a good stereo set, NAD amplifier and Tannoy D500 loudspeakers, and the quality is good, although a digital remastering would be a better thing. \n\nThere is a CD on the market ( supplied from Germany, manufactured in Argentina ) but reviews say the CD quality is flat and poor.\n\nSince this recording dates from 1972, the quality is not what you might expect from a modern digitally remastered version. Still, it is very acceptable and I hope you will enjoy it. Please let me know what you think of it.\n\nSincere thanks to the original unknown uploader.\n\nRobbie60.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Steve Miller: Guitar, Vocals\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ben Sidran: Keyboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dicky Thompson: Keyboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Gary Mallaber: Drums\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Jesse Ed Davis: Guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Jim Keltner: Drums\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Roger Clark: Drums\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Gerald Johnson: Bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Jackie King: Drums\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   1 Welcome 1:14 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   2 Enter Maurice 3:52 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   3 High on You Mama 3:35 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   4 Heal Your Heart 3:20 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   5 The Sun Is Going Down 1:35 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   6 Somebody Somewhere Help Me 2:30 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   7 Love's Riddle 3:23 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   8 Fandango 4:56 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢   9 Nothing Lasts 4:03 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  10 Journey from Eden 6:24\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b035366c4c2457c7c336850f48bf702785df9b67","amp;dn":"Steve+Miller+Band+-+Recall+The+Beginning...A+Journey+From+Eden++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b035366c4c2457c7c336850f48bf702785df9b67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,53,54,108,76,36,87,199,195,54,133,15,72,191,112,39,133,223,155,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
