This program collects information about computer hardware and how people use Windows 7.\n\n* Speed up Windows Thumb Time-Delay:\n\nWindows 7 has provided a cool feature with ability to preview taskbar thumbnails whenever the mouse is hovered on the program icon. However, you may notice that it does have some latency to display the preview after mouse over the icon, Thumb Time-Delay has been improved to avoid this problem.\n\n* NTFS; Disable 8.3 Names and Last Access:\n\nNTFS Files systems create file names in 8.3 format. Disabling this option reduces the overhead during the creation of new files or directories.\n\n* Improve DNS Caching:\n\nBy default Windows also caches erroneous data and this can take space of valid cache items and thus slow down your Internet access. This will tell windows not to cache erroneous DNS data at all.\n\n* SpeedUp Access to AVI Files:\n\nSpeeds up the access of AVI folders as well as makes the renaming and deletion of AVIs easier.\n\n* Enable Boot Optimization:\n\nThe Boot Optimization function will automatically defragment boot files and rearrange them so that all boot files are in close proximity to one another.\n\n* Allocate more Critical Threads to Increase Performance:\n\nThis Option lets Windows create more critical threads for when your system load is high in order to improve your system's performance.\n\n* Unload DLLS from Memory after Use:\n\nRemove DLL's from memory after use to free up more resources.\n\n* Disable Network Redirector File Caching for Workstation Service:\n\nOn network computers, when data is written to a file, it is written to the cache and not immediately flushed to the redirector.\n\n* Improve Core System Performance:\n\nThis option lets drivers and system code move to disk whenever required as sometimes more physical RAM is requiered to run an application\n\n* Increase NTFS Performance:\n\nThe time stamp for the last accessed files and folders are updated by Windows and this update may take time.\n\n* Enable Self-Healing Capability of NTFS File System:\n\nIn earlier version of Windows, NTFS marks the volume &quot;dirty&quot; upon detecting file-system corruption and CHKDSK is required to be run by taking the volume &quot;offline&quot;.\n\nWith self-healing NTFS is the new feature of Windows Vista and Windows 7, in which an NTFS worker thread is spawned in the background which performs a localized fix-up of damaged data structures, with only the corrupted files/folders remaining unavailable without locking out the entire volume.\n\n* Stop Automatic Rebooting of your System after Windows Update:\n\nStops automatic rebooting of the system after automatic udpates.\n\n* Disable User Tracking:\n\nPrevents the system from tracking the programs users run, the paths they navigate, and the documents they open. Although somewhat helpful, this tracking is a pontetial privacy threat.\n\n* Show Extensions for Known File Types:\n\nEnable to display file extensions (e.g. DOC, XLS, EXE) as part of file names. This can help you tell disguised malicious software from normal files. It also increases the performance of Vista folders.\n\n* Show Hidden Files and Folders:\n\nThis is rarely required for novice users, but is very useful for experienced users as it gives them better control over their computer.\n\n* Always Show Menus:\n\nBy default Windows Explorer does not display the menu bar.\n\n* Use Checkboxes to Select Items:\n\nAdds Checkboxes to file views to make it easier to select several files at once, wich can be useful if it is difficult for you to hold the CTRL key while clicking to select multiple files.\n\n* UAC disabled... make things work correctly with UAC off...\n\nUser Access Control (UAC) can be a very annoying feature. Allow operations without administrator consent (similar to Windows XP).\n\n* xDark x86 4.0 RG Tweaks...\n\n... and many more...\n\n# xDark Context Menu:\n\n* Add &quot;Take Ownership&quot; to the right-click context menu\n* Add &quot;Open with Notepad&quot; to the right-click context menu\n* All items have an &quot;edit..&quot; on right-click context menu sending to notepad\n* Add &quot;Copy File Names&quot; to Context Menu\n* Add &quot;Copy To/Move To&quot; to the right-click context menu\n* Add &quot;Register/UnRegister Dll&quot; to the right-click context menu\n* Add and associate system files to open with Restorator to the right-click context menu\n* Add &quot;Atributes&quot; -&gt; Toggle Archive Atribute -&gt; Toggle Read Only Atribute -&gt; Toggle Hidden Atribute -&gt; Toggle System Atribute; to the right-click context menu\n* Add &quot;Install&quot; to right-click on Font Files\n* Add &quot;Appearance&quot; to the right-click context menu\n* Add &quot;Media Info&quot; to the right-click context menu\n\n* Remove unlikely templates from the New menu\n\n# xDark Desktop Context Menu:\n\n* Add &quot;Clear Clipboard&quot; to the right-click context menu of &quot;Desktop&quot;\n* Add &quot;Kill Not Responding Tasks&quot; to the right-click context menu of &quot;Desktop&quot;\n* Add &quot;Restart Explorer&quot; to the right-click context menu of &quot;Desktop&quot;\n* Remove &quot;Fonts&quot; from Desktop and Other right-click context menus\n* Add &quot;Show / Hide Hidden Files&quot; to the right-click context menu of &quot;Desktop&quot;\n* Add &quot;Show / Hide File Extensions&quot; to the right-click context menu of &quot;Desktop&quot;\n* Add &quot;Run&quot; to the right-click context menu of &quot;Desktop&quot;\n\n# xDark Computer Context Menu:\n\n* Add &quot;Command Prompt Here&quot; on the right-click context-menus of Drives, Folders &amp; My Computer\n* Add &quot;Advanced System Properties&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Calculator&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Control Panel&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Device Manager&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Control Mode&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Notepad&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Registry Editor&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Task Manager&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Services&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;System Configuration&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n* Add &quot;Shutdown&quot; to the right click menu of &quot;Computer&quot;\n\n# xDark Special Context Menu:\n\n* Copy Path\n* Command Prompt\n* Explore Here\n* Batch Rename\n* Search and Replace\n* Sign Files\n* Path Operations\n* Select by Type\n* Mount Path as Virtual Drive\n* iPhone PNGs\n\n- xDark v4.0 Notes:\n\n* xDark v4.0 Exclusive Default Theme\n* xDark 4 Seasons Dark Orb Start Button\n* xDark Exclusive Lights In The Dark Systems Sounds Scheme\n* 3 xDark System Cursors\n* xDark HD Exclusive System Icons (Almost All System Icons Are Customized)\n* xDark HD Exclusive Nvidia Top Shell\n* xDark Exclusive GodMode Custom Panel and GodMode Creator\n* xDark HD Exclusive Wallpapers Set\n* xDark HD Exclusive Dark Surrealism User Account Pictures\n* xDark Exlusive Integrated Shell On Top\n* xDark Exclusive Lights In The Dark Edition Branding\n* Hard Disk Changes to xDark HDD Default\n* xDark Unwelcome Center\n* xDark Gadget Gallery + Extra Black Gadgtes\n* xDark Context Menu &amp; Folder Menu\n* xDark Network &amp; Internet Optimized\n* Super xDark Administrator\n* AutoLogon &amp; Boot Optimization\n* xDark Power Tools\n* xDark Installer Integrated\n* xDark HD Graphics &amp; 3D Experience\n* and much more...\n\n- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ - ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ - ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ - ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ - -\n\n- Integrated Applications (xDark Post Install script): (alphabetical order)\n\n* 7Zip 9.20 + 7Z Split...\n\n...
