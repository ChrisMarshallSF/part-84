His girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) is often neglected by his dedication to work, and his compulsive personality suggests a conflicted man. But on Christmas Eve, Chuck proposes marriage to Kelly right before embarking on a large assignment. On the assignment, a plane crash strands Chuck on a remote island, and his fast-paced life is slowed to a crawl, as he is miles removed from any human contact. Finding solace only in a volleyball that he befriends, Chuck must now learn to endure the emotional and physical stress of his new life, unsure of when he may return to the civilization he knew before. Cast Away reunites star Hanks with director Robert Zemeckis, their first film together since 1994's Oscar-winning Forrest Gump.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759a9918b9c81a01ca3051cf2a521fb1f7d7363e","amp;dn":"Cast+Away%282000%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759a9918b9c81a01ca3051cf2a521fb1f7d7363e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,154,153,24,185,200,26,1,202,48,81,207,42,82,31,177,247,215,54,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
