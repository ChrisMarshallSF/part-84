When Jack is       \n    forced to leave Vegas, he packs up his old Cadillac and hits the road    \n    for Atlantic City. But his car dies in the desert and Jack is left       \n    stranded in the small town of Lost Springs. There, Jack meets jazz       \n    legend turned mechanic, Doc Bishop (Robert Guillaume), who helps him     \n    with his car trouble. Although Jack is far from the stage, he begins     \n    to find himself feeling at home in the small town. When he meets         \n    dreamy eyed bartender, Lauren Wells (Melissa Joan Hart), Jack starts     \n    to see there is more to life than chasing fame and fortune. Doc          \n    encourages Jack to explore his true love of music, while Lauren          \n    provides the audience he has always wanted. But as Jack realizes this    \n    town has more to offer him than the bright lights of the big city,       \n    his Vegas past catches up with him -- what unfolds is comedy at the      \n    crossroads of life.                                                      \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
