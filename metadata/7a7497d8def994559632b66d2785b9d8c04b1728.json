For example, you have installed 3rd party software &quot;Internet Download Manager&quot; and its executable file name is &quot;IDMan.exe&quot;. If you try to launch it by just typing &quot;IDMan&quot; in RUN, it'll give error that Windows cannot find the exe. But if you add its reference in Registry using &quot;Run Editor&quot;, you can launch it by simply typing its name in RUN.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a7497d8def994559632b66d2785b9d8c04b1728","amp;dn":"Run+Editor+by+Jainy081","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a7497d8def994559632b66d2785b9d8c04b1728","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,116,151,216,222,249,148,85,150,50,182,109,39,133,185,216,192,75,23,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
