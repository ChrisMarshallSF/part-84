Field, to the introduction of such cover material as Wilbert Harrison's &quot;Let's Work Together&quot; and J.J. Cale's &quot;Sensitive Kind.&quot; Field uses a spare production style, light on atmosphere and heavy, as is the current fashion, on unusual percussion. This makes for an identifiable sound, to be sure, but you can't help thinking that it isn't what The Bluesbreakers sound like on a good night in a small club. The result, as intended, was Mayall's first chart appearance in 15 years, but as a commercial comeback, the record ultimately failed.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing &amp; Personnel\n\n\nI Want To Go  2:20 \n\n Bass [Fretless 5 String] - Freebo \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Rhythm Guitar - Cid Sanchez \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n Vocals, Lead Guitar - John Mayall \n  \nCongo Square  4:43 \n\n Bass - Bobby Haynes \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Lead Guitar - Coco Montoya \n Percussion - Walfredo Reyes \n Piano - Steve Conn \n Rhythm Guitar - Cid Sanchez \n Vocals, Harmonica - John Mayall \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth\n \nSend Me Down To Vickburg  2:14  \n\n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Engineer - Bobby Manuel \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n  \nWithout Her  3:36 \n\n Bass [String] - Bobby Haynes \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Rhythm Guitar - Debbie Davies \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n Vocals, Harmonica - John Mayall \n  \nSensitive Kind  5:18 \n\n Bass [Fretless 5 String] - Freebo \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Lead Guitar - Coco Montoya \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n Vocals, Electric Piano - John Mayall \n   \nJacksboro Highway  4:02 \n\n Bass [Fretless 5 String] - Freebo \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Piano - Steve Conn \n Rhythm Guitar - Coco Montoya \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n Vocals, Harmonica - John Mayall \n   \nLet's Work Together  3:20 \n\n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n Vocals, Piano, Harmonica - John Mayall \n   \nI Can't Complain  4:15 \n\n Bass - Bobby Haynes \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Lead Guitar - Coco Montoya \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n Vocals, Harmonica, Guitar [12 String] - John Mayall \n   \nBlack Cat Moan  3:52\n \n Bass - Bobby Haynes \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Rhythm Guitar - Coco Montoya \n Slide Guitar - Sonny Landreth \n Vocals, Synthesizer - John Mayall \n   \nSugarcane  2:49 \n\n Bass - Bobby Haynes \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Percussion - Walfredo Reyes\n Vocals, Harmonica - John Mayall \n  \nAll My Life  3:57 \n \n Bass - Tim Drummond \n Drums - Joe Yuele \n Lead Guitar - Coco Montoya \n Vocals, Piano, Harmonica - John Mayall \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b65c89e3ff6c2ab87e8f57628426c8e004bc0d5d","amp;dn":"John+Mayall+-+A+Sense+Of+Place++%5B1990%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b65c89e3ff6c2ab87e8f57628426c8e004bc0d5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,92,137,227,255,108,42,184,126,143,87,98,132,38,200,224,4,188,13,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
