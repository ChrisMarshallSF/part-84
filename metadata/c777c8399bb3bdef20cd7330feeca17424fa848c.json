With a career that spans more than 50 years and continues to this day, Borgnine has endeared himself to film and television audiences alike. \n\nIn Private Screenings: Ernest Borgnine, Borgnine discusses his career that began by enrolling in the Randall School of Dramatic Arts in Hartford. From there, he broke into the professional ranks at the Barter Theatre in Virginia. Following his years at the Barter Theatre, he heard about a casting call, knocked on the door and asked if they had anything for him. A man came to the door and invited him to do a screen test. That man was director Robert Siodmak, who showed the screen test to producer Louis de Rouchemont. In no time, Borgnine was cast in the Lloyd Bridges labor-management drama, Whistle at Eaton Falls.\n\nWith the energy of a man in his 20s, Borgnine recounts such memories as being cast in From Here to Eternity opposite such top-name stars as Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr and Frank Sinatra. It was only his fourth film. He also recalls being put under contract and not getting work; his surprise OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® win for Marty, which was presented to him by Grace Kelly; his various marriages; and what he really wanted to title his book.\n\nPrivate Screenings: Ernest Borgnine is full of additional fascinating anecdotes:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ His mom was a countess, which makes him, in his own words, &quot;a count of no account.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Prior to becoming an actor, he served in the Navy for 10 years.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Marty was originally made to be a &quot;tax loss.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The motivation to go into acting came from his mother.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ His inspiration to venture into television came from a child selling chocolate bars.\n\nAt the end of PRIVATE SCREENINGS, Borgnine reflects on his career: &quot;I'd like to think that maybe through my pictures, through my television, through everything crazy in the life I've led, maybe somewhere I left a laugh or two. Making people laugh: This is what it's all about.&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c777c8399bb3bdef20cd7330feeca17424fa848c","amp;dn":"Private+Screenings+Ernest+Borgnine+%28TV%29+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c777c8399bb3bdef20cd7330feeca17424fa848c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,119,200,57,155,179,189,239,32,205,115,48,254,236,161,116,36,250,132,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
