I made the album art (with a picture from the same artist that does the real album art).\n\nI had uploded this before but some of the tracks repeated sections so I re-cut the tracks with a different program and all the songs should be fine now.\n\nSeed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178fd1b575fdc244ae35331ea1af8fda53c44cf8","amp;dn":"Dance+Gavin+Dance+-+Live+at+The+Boardwalk+%5BFIXED%5D+%28bg4545%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178fd1b575fdc244ae35331ea1af8fda53c44cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,143,209,181,117,253,194,68,174,53,51,30,161,175,143,218,83,196,76,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
