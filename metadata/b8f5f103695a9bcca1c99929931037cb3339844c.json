I know nothing of Macs, and don't intent to, I did this simply to say I did it. I've deleted my image after verifying it works. That should go to show you, if it can work for someone who knows literally nothing about Macs, it will work for you. \n\nZipped - no password - 75MB~ ZIP versus the 150MB~ extracted. \nI would have left individual files but I have limited bandwidth, so that's two people with everything versus one for every 150MB I send out. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f5f103695a9bcca1c99929931037cb3339844c","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+VMware+instructions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f5f103695a9bcca1c99929931037cb3339844c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,245,241,3,105,90,155,204,161,201,153,41,147,16,55,203,51,57,132,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
