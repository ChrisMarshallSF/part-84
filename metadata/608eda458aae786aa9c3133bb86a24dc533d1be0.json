One of the world's most legendary monsters is a     \n         sea serpent known as Cadborosaurus, or &quot;Caddy,&quot; which has     \n         been reported off the coast of British Columbia for more      \n         than a century. But to science, it doesn't officially         \n         exist. Now Pat travels to Vancouver Island to track it        \n         down. He questions eyewitnesses, explores the myths of        \n         the coastal people who have occupied the area for more        \n          than 5,000 years and confers with top oceanographers.         \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                          ORENJI, 2HD, DHD, CTU                        \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
