All songs were written and composed by Jody Turner.\n\nRock Goddess was an all-female heavy metal band from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal era that briefly enjoyed cult status in the early 1980s in Great Britain.\n\nThe band was formed in Wandsworth, South London in 1977, by sisters Jody Turner (guitar and vocals) and Julie Turner (drums) when they were thirteen and nine years old respectively. They recruited school friend Tracey Lamb on bass guitar and Donnica Colman on keyboards to complete the first line-up. The girls rehearsed intensively and, through a friend, managed to place a track on a sampler album, which circulated in the London music underground. Meanwhile, John Turner, Jody and Julie's father, who ran a music shop used his connections to get the band their first gigs. Finally, after the production of a four tracks demo tape and an appearance at the Reading Festival in 1982, the band obtained a recording contract with A&amp;M.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;festival&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Goddess_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Goddess_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaecoAadJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaecoAadJ&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:49\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
