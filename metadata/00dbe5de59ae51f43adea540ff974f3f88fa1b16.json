Max raises the possibility that the revolutions in other parts of the world would come to the US. He says the economic systems favored by some corrupt Arab regime are similar to that of the US, that a mass movement against it in the US is inevitable. He also says the genie index is very high, which reveals the concentration of wealth among the top strata of the society. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solari.com/blog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solari.com/blog&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is extracted audio from the Press TV video.
