Now she knows.\n\nPOtHS 3 - Conspiracy Facts - Part 87 - Paul McCartney died 1966 - Harrison Death Bed Confession\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech  --  High Speed Server\n\n\nIsn't this refreshing. A conspiracy that has ZERO effect on todays mess in The World. After watching this documentary, I lean towards the idea that PAUL IS DEAD. How can I say that??? After the breakup of the Beatles, Paul really never produced any music of &quot;Beatle Quality.&quot; After the breakup Lennon did, although neither produced any music of Beatle Legend after their breakup.\n\n\nPaul McCartney never wrote &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed.&quot; He never formed the band Wings. He never clashed with Yoko, became a vegetarian, or fathered any of his children. When Queen Elizabeth knighted him in 1997, she was actually knighting someone else. This is because, conspiracy-minded Beatlemaniacs say, Paul McCartney secretly died in 1966. Theorists claim the other Beatles covered up his death ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ hiring someone who looked like him, sang like him, and had the same jovial personality. But the guilt eventually got to them and they began hiding clues in their music. In the song &quot;Taxman,&quot; George Harrison gave his &quot;advice for those who die,&quot; meaning Paul. The entire Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had formed a &quot;new&quot; band featuring a fictional member named Billy Shears ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ supposedly the name of Paul's replacement. The album contained John Lennon's &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; which had the lyrics &quot;He blew his mind out in a car&quot; and the recorded phrase &quot;Paul is dead, miss him, miss him,&quot; which becomes evident only when the song is played backward. Lennon also mumbled, &quot;I buried Paul&quot; at the end of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (in interviews, Lennon said the phrase was actually &quot;cranberry sauce&quot; and denied the existence of any backward messages).\n\nPaul-is-dead believers think the Beatles accompanied these backward tape loops and veiled references to death with album covers that illustrated the loss of their friend. The original cover of 1966's Yesterday and Today album featured the Beatles posed amid raw meat and dismembered doll parts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ symbolizing McCartney's gruesome accident. If fans placed a mirror in front of the Sgt. Pepper album cover, the words Lonely Hearts on the drum logo could be read as &quot;1 ONE 1 X HE DIE 1 ONE 1.&quot; And of course, there's the Abbey Road cover, on which John, George and Ringo forwent all pretense and pretended to cross the street as a funeral procession. John wore all white, like a clergyman. Ringo, the mourner, dressed in black. George donned jeans, like a gravedigger. Paul wore no shoes (he didn't need them, because he was dead) and walked out of step with the others.\n\nIf Paul is dead, then his imposter is still at large. He met and married Linda Eastman, with whom he had four children before losing her to breast cancer in 1998. He released a live album in 1993 called Paul Is Live (likely story), and produced more than 20 solo albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that's not even counting the ones released by Wings. Then he endured a horrible divorce from Heather Mills, which may have made him wish he were dead ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or, at least, were still Billy Shears. So who is the real McCartney? The world may never know. (DNA could prove that)This whole world is a deception. Why not the Beatles too???\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMore Torrents in this series at          ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
