He discusses the social and political background of India in the Buddha's time and traces the development of his thought. He also assesses the rapid and widespread assimilation of Buddhism and its contemporary relevance. Well-paced and informative, this introduction will enlighten not only those who study Buddhism and comparative religion but anyone intrigued by the remarkable philosophy of one of the greatest religious thinkers. \n\n# Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA (June 7, 2001)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-13: 978-0192854537","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f37e8156aefa77987555f182b79e89ed2a6b321","amp;dn":"The+Buddha%3A+A+Very+Short+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f37e8156aefa77987555f182b79e89ed2a6b321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,55,232,21,106,239,167,121,135,85,95,24,43,121,232,158,210,166,179,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
