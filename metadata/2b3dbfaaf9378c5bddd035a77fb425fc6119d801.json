Steel and slide guitar by Harry Bodine meld perfectly with Mike Milligan's bluesy vocals, and what results is a mature sound that says they've been around the block a few times. The lyrics, too, emit pangs of a musician's jadedness on certain tracks like, &quot;Can't Live Without It.&quot; (&quot;Another night/Another club/ Another line across my face&quot;). The concepts are simple but sincere, the playing not fancy but tight. This is a good record to play when you hang out by the levee. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b3dbfaaf9378c5bddd035a77fb425fc6119d801","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Delta+Roux+-+Dirty+Shoes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b3dbfaaf9378c5bddd035a77fb425fc6119d801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,61,191,170,249,55,140,91,221,208,53,167,127,180,37,252,97,25,216,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
