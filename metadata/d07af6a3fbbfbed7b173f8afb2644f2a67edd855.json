Her visa was approved Thursday following a protest campaign that included letters from the American Civil Liberties Union and nine members of Congress. Asked why the United States at first refused her visit, Joya says, &quot;I am talking about the blind bombardment by the NATO forces, and about the occupation of my country. I think these are the reasons that the U.S. and NATO are afraid of me.&quot;\n\n\n- &quot;Stop These Massacres&quot;: Ex-Afghan Parliamentarian Malayia Joya Calls For End to U.S. Occupation of Afghanistan\n \nU.S.-led NATO forces in Afghanistan fear increasing opposition after photographs of U.S. troops posing over dead Afghan civilians were published last week by German news magazine Der Speigal and broadcast by Democracy Now!. Rolling Stone magazine has just published 18 additional images. The photographs are graphic and have been compared to images that emerged from the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The soldiers in the photographs are on trial for forming a secret &quot;kill team&quot; in Afghanistan that murdered unarmed Afghan civilians at random and collected body parts. NATO air strikes have also recently led to more than 15 civilian deaths in the past month. We get reaction from former Afghan member of parliament, Malalai Joya.\n\n\n- &quot;This is Economic Treason&quot;: 500,000 March in London Protesting Public Spending Cuts and Corporate Tax Dodgers\n \nAs many as 500,000 protesters marched in London on Saturday to protest Britain's deepest cuts to public spending since World War II. The protests come after U.K. officials estimated corporate taxes would be reduced even as it tackles a $235-billion deficit and plans to cut more than 300,000 public sector jobs. Meanwhile in the United States, protesters gathered in 40 cities on Saturday to oppose tax cuts for the wealthy amid budget cuts to public services. We broadcast a video report from the streets of London and speak to British journalist Johann Hari and Allison Kilkenny of Citizen Radio in New York.\n\n\n- Will Syria Lift Decades-Old Emergency Law? Street Protests &amp; Deadly Crackdown Force Assad Regime To Consider Political Changes\n \nScores of protesters have been killed in Syria during 10 days of protests against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. In an attempt to appease protesters, Assad's administration has reportedly vowed to lift the emergency law, which for nearly 50 years has allowed the government to detain people without charge. &quot;For more than 40 years, people have been politically suppressed,&quot; says Bassam Haddad, the director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Mason University. &quot;That suppression was coupled more recently in the past 20 some years with neo-liberal-like economic policies that have created huge gaps between different segments of Syrian society.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d07af6a3fbbfbed7b173f8afb2644f2a67edd855","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+28+mar+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d07af6a3fbbfbed7b173f8afb2644f2a67edd855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,122,246,163,251,191,190,215,177,115,248,175,178,100,79,42,103,237,216,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
