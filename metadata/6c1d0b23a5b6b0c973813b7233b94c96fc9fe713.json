I ripped the CD myself using lossless encoding (FLAC).\n\nThe tracks are:\n\n1.) Lady Be Good\n2.) If I Had You\n3.) Limehouse Blues\n4.) Mister Basie\n5.) Reunion Blues\n6.) More Than You Know\n7.) Just You, Just Me\n8.)

Further, they create melodic and harmonic beauties with none of the collisions or confusions suggested by the sonic similarities of vibes and piano...&quot;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c1d0b23a5b6b0c973813b7233b94c96fc9fe713","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+with+Milt+Jackon-+Two+of+the+Few","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c1d0b23a5b6b0c973813b7233b94c96fc9fe713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,29,11,35,165,182,176,201,115,129,59,114,51,185,76,150,252,159,231,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
