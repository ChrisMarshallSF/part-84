Sharif Abdel Kouddous Reports Live From Cairo\n\nHundreds of thousands of Egyptian pro-democracy protesters have returned to Cairo's Tahrir Square in defiance of violent attacks from supporters of President Hosni Mubarak in the last two days. The New York Times reports the Obama administration has opened talks with Egyptian officials on Mubarak's immediate resignation. The proposal under discussion would see Vice President Omar Suleiman lead a transitional government before elections later this year, however, Suleiman remains deeply unpopular in Egypt. Pro-democracy organizers have labeled today the &quot;Day of Departure,&quot; a final push for Mubarak's immediate resignation. The demonstrations immediately swelled at the end of Friday prayers. We speak to Democracy Now! Senior Producer Sharif Abdel Kouddous who reports live from Tahrir Square.\n\n\n- Eliminate the Witnesses: Committee to Protect Journalists Criticizes Murbarak's Policy of Attacking and Silencing Journalists in Egypt\n\nThe Mubarak regime's violent crackdown has included deliberate targeting of journalists covering the protests across Egypt. News outlets including Al Jazeera, CBS News, ABC News, Fox News, CNN, BBC, The Washington Post, The New York Times, Australian Broadcasting, Danish TV2 News and Swiss television have reported assaults, intimidation, or arrests of their workers. We speak to Frank Smyth with the Committee to Protect Journalists, who reports there have been a record of 100 attacks on journalists, 30 detentions, 26 assaults, and eight cases of media equipment seized. &quot;This is worst case of the most blatant violence against the press I have seen in my 24 years reporting, and my 10 years at CPJ,&quot; Smyth says. &quot;Clearly the Mubarak regime is responsible. They are implementing policy to eliminate witnesses to what is occurring. Mubarak regime literally trying to unplug Egypt from the world.&quot;\n\n\n- Video Report on the Battle For Tahrir: An Inside Look at How Pro-Democracy Activists Reclaimed Tahrir Square After Attacks by Mubarak Forces\n\nOn Thursday, pro-democracy activists ventured back to Tahrir Square, to reclaim the downtown Cairo public space, which had become a battleground in the effort to oust President Hosni Mubarak. Democracy Now! producers Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Hany Massoud walked through the streets, talking with Cairo residents-many who were injured from the attacks the day before-and witnesses the efforts to cleaning up the trash and rock-filled square while also organizing a system of grassroots resistance and community care programs to defend the square from pro-Mubarak forces who threatened to return.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acebb7888c070779d88c85c1cdf3644134b7cb04","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+04+feb+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acebb7888c070779d88c85c1cdf3644134b7cb04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,235,183,136,140,7,7,121,216,140,133,193,205,243,100,65,52,183,203,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
