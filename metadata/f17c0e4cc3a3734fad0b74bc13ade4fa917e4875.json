It isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the usual kind of problem. Its just that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s noticed that his mother is a bit of a MILF.\nLike, really noticed. A lot.\nUnfortunately (or not, depending on how you view such things), Yagami isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the only one who has noticedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nProject notes:\nBack in the old Lupin Gang Anime days I had a more-or-less finished version of Yagami 1-2, but I was missing a translation for 3. None of my regular translators wanted to touch it.\nTo give you an idea of the issue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I bought the finished version of 1-2 to a conventionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Animazement, I think? IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d say about a dozen people showed up in the theatre to check it out. They had all bailed by the time the first eyecatch came around, leaving me alone in the theatre with the projectionist. It was not my happiest moment. And its a shame, because Yagami is pretty damn funny. I suspect it might be better received nowadays, now that incestuous romantic comedies have become their own twisted little subgenere. That, and the internet is full of perverts.\nLike with Exper Zenon, I once again do not have any translation of romanization for the ending theme. Maybe if I get a translator for episode 3 I can get that flaw corrected as well.\n\nAVISynth script (video 2.0):\nAVISource(&quot;yagami1-lagarith.avi&quot;)\nAnimeIVTC(mode=4,omode=1)\ncrop(6,0,-12,0)\nSpline64Resize(640,480)\nFFT3DFilter(sigma=2.0, plane=4, bw=48, bh=48, bt=4, ow=16, oh=16, sharpen=0, interlaced=false)\nvmToon()","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17c0e4cc3a3734fad0b74bc13ade4fa917e4875","amp;dn":"%5BPPP-SUB%5D+Yagami%5C%27s+Family+Problem+ep1+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f17c0e4cc3a3734fad0b74bc13ade4fa917e4875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,124,14,76,195,163,115,79,173,11,116,188,19,173,228,250,145,126,72,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
