Some sound dropout, and occasional picture breakup &amp; sharp editing between tracks as the camera moves from one side to the other but otherwise rather good although the a/v sync is off in places.\n\nSamson Birmingham: Single tripod mounted camera shoot nearly dead on to the band over the heads of the crowd. Clear picture and sound although some tape wear is evident although you can see Bruce Dickinson's moustache!!!\n\nUFO London 92: Pro shoot from TV broadcast but shot really close up.\n\n\nLine Up:\nSamson\nBruce, Bruce (Dickinson) - Vocals\nPaul Samson - Guitar\nChris Alymer - Bass\nMel Gaynor - Drums (81)\nThunderstick - Drums (80)\n\nUFO\nPhil Mogg - Vocals\nLawrence Archer - Guitar\nPete Way - Bass\nClive Edwards - Drums\nJem Davis - Keyboards\n\n\nSong Listing\nSamson - Reading 1981 (45 mins)\n[Behind the scenes / Going to the stage]\nBig Brother\nTake it Like a Man\n[camera moves to Paul's side]]\nNice Girl\n[camera movies back to Chris' side]\nEarth Mother\n[back on Paul's side]\nVice Versa\n[back to Chris' side]\nBright Lights\nGuitar Solo\nWalking Out On You\nHammerhead\nRiding With the Angels\n--encore break--\nGravy Train (new song - unreleased)\nBand Intros / Solos\nGravy Train (reprise)\n[backstage footage]\n\nSamson - Birmingham 1980 (50mins)\nIntro\n[unknown instrumental]\nBig Brother\nSix Foot Under\nHard Times\nTake Me to Your Leader\n[unknown song]\nInside Out\nVice Versa\nHammerhead\nTake it Like a Man\nToo Close to Rock\n\n[unknown clip of Paul Samson in the 2000s\n\nUFO - Country Club 1992 (20mins)\nRunning up the Highway\n[interview with Phil and Pete]\n[audience interviews etc]\nBackdoor Man\nBorderline\n\n\nPlease note I can't seed 24/7 due to the rules of my ISP but will always return until everything is completely seeded, (and probably afterwards too!)
