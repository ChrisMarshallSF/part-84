This was a confusing set. We didn\\'t \nknow what to do with the outfit, or if the socks belonged at all. You\\'ll \nhave to decide that.\n\nPublished on 10 Sep 2010\n\nSomething about St Clair reminds me of the song \\&quot;Cleveland Rocks.\\&quot; Maybe \nit\\'s her attitude, or her style, but it\\'s something very cool. You get a \nsense of that here, and her down to earth character comes through. \nSuggested listening for this set is Mott the Hoople, obviously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de7ee5966c7c1b43dbda3573c83437b63b3b2bac","amp;dn":"figurebaby.com+-+Saint+Clair+-+145+pics+in+2+complete+sets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de7ee5966c7c1b43dbda3573c83437b63b3b2bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,126,229,150,108,124,27,67,219,218,53,115,200,52,55,182,59,59,43,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
