Ripley's pod crashes from her ship onto a desolate planet while in hyper-sleep, she is the only survivor. She is found right outside a prison colony and ends up having to stay there until a rescue team arrives from her company, Weyland Yutani. However, she is not the only survivor from the crash...\n\nGraphics: \n---------\nQuite cool for the Sega Genesis. Ripley, the aliens, the victims - all of them are well attended to with pretty impressive sprites and are overall very well-reproduced. The aliens move exactly like in the movies and come at you from a distance once they spot you, pretty scary and intimidating if you ask me. The human victims are very nice and disturbing with some bound to the walls in discomfort. The chestburster effect is totally gross (translation: AWESOME!). Everything has a sort of grim atmosphere to it, it's kind of like &quot;Hellraiser&quot; meets &quot;Aliens&quot;.\n\nScreenshots:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/i/alien31.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/i/alien31.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/i/alien32.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/i/alien32.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nHow To Start The Game:\n1.
