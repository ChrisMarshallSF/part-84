He would be found by one of the local tribes. They would teach how to handle a sword. He would eventually become quite good with it. He would then return to the States and would visit an old Army buddy. When he gets there, he discovers that he and his wife are divorced. What they don't know is that he (his friend) was playing in a crooked casino in Vegas, and accumulated a large debt. The owner's willing to forget his debt, if he does something for him. His friend is a chemist and they want him to make some designer drugs, and in order to make sure he does it they try and kidnap his son. But lucky Nick is there, Nick saves his son but not his wife. He and the boy begin a road trip for Vegas to save his father, with the owner's people in pursuit.\n\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096945/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096945/&lt;/a&gt;\n                    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3057483677157df93baa0b05fbbf8dcaa7df6bf8","amp;dn":"Blind+Fury+%281989%29+720p+HDTV+-+Frost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3057483677157df93baa0b05fbbf8dcaa7df6bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,87,72,54,119,21,125,249,59,170,11,5,251,191,141,202,167,223,107,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
