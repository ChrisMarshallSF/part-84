I was wondering whether it would be at all possible for me to visit you at MIT [the Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in order to record a video conversation based on your thoughts about the unfolding environmental disaster now threatening our world. I have read with great interest and trepidation your observations on the probability of nuclear annihilation (apocalypse soon), and would greatly value a chance to discuss in more detail the threat of this other, slower, but equally devastating apocalypse. I would be very grateful to have your consideration on how we have come to this critical point in history. Why the powers of the world are so slow in acting to try to prevent this catastrophe and why the American government appears to be in denial about it.\n\n-Cornelia Parker to Noam Chomsky\n\n\nOn 13 February 2008 a new exhibition by Parker opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, organised in partnership with Friends of the Earth. It featured a 40 minute film - Chomskian Abstract, 2007 - presenting her interview with the world-renowned writer and theorist Noam Chomsky. Exhibited alongside Chomskian Abstract, 2007, ParkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Poison and Antidote Drawings, 2004 featured black ink containing snake venom and white ink containing anti venom.\n\n-Wikipedia\n\nVideo - avi\n===========\nSize : 340MB\nRuntime : 00:41:46\n\nVideo Codec : DivX\nResolution : 720x400\nFramerate : 25fps\nVideo Bitrate : 1000kbs\nAudio Codec : MP3\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nAudio Bitrate : 128 kb/s [joint stereo]\n\n\nScreens:\n======\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/c1/i2/2812/H5T7NzO.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/c1/i2/2812/H5T7NzO.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/c1/i2/3210/cOpUUrVH.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/c1/i2/3210/cOpUUrVH.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/c1/i2/2006/01w9EfZS.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/c1/i2/2006/01w9EfZS.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAll thanks to &quot;robokun&quot;\n=======================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e3fa6ad245510bfd21d826d43e5557589d9213","amp;dn":"Chomskian+Abstract+-+2007.03.09+-+Cornelia+Parker+-+GCJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e3fa6ad245510bfd21d826d43e5557589d9213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,227,250,106,210,69,81,11,253,33,216,38,212,62,85,87,88,157,146,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
