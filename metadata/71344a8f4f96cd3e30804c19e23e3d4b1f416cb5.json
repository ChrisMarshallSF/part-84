In reality, most crashes are caused by malfunctioning device drivers and kernel modules. In case of a kernel error, most computers running Windows do not show a blue screen unless they are configured to do so. Instead these systems suddenly reboot without any notice.\n\nWhoCrashed shows the drivers which have been crashing your computer with a single click. In most cases it can pinpoint the offending drivers which have been causing misery on your computer system in the past. It does post-mortem crashdump analysis and presents all gathered information in a comprehensible way.\n\nNormally, debugging skills and a set of debugging tools are required to do post-mortem crash dump analysis. By using this utility you do not need any debugging skills to be able to find out what drivers are causing trouble to your computer.\n\nHome Page - http://www.resplendence.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71344a8f4f96cd3e30804c19e23e3d4b1f416cb5","amp;dn":"WhoCrashed+Professional+3.01+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71344a8f4f96cd3e30804c19e23e3d4b1f416cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,52,74,143,79,150,205,62,48,128,76,25,226,62,61,75,31,65,108,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
