The centre has\n                been open for a month, and Judge Patrick Coburn has\n                so far been unable to convince his staff of his new\n                approach to justice, never mind the local community.\n                To add insult to injury, the PJC has been broken into\n                overnight. It doesn't look like much has been taken,\n                but a key memo from the Ministry of Justice is\n                missing. It is down to Coburn to find the culprit\n                before the centre's reputation is damaged any further.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                First release was out of sync.\n\n                The rules for naming releases don't state what to do\n                when there are two series that are from the same\n                country and also the same year.
