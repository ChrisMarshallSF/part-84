Jean-Luc         \n           Godard was born in 1930; Francois Truffaut two years           \n           later. Love of movies brings them together. They write in      \n           the same magazines, Cahiers du Cinema and Arts. When the       \n           younger of the two becomes a filmmaker with &quot;The 400           \n           Blows&quot;, which triumphs in Cannes in 1959, he helps his         \n           older friend shift to directing, offering him a                \n           screenplay which already has a title, A bout de souffle,       \n           or Breathless. Through the 1960s the two loyally support       \n           each other. History and politics separate them in 1968,        \n           when Godard plunges into radical politics but Truffaut         \n           continues his career as before. Between the two of them,       \n           the actor Jean-Pierre Leaud is torn like a child caught        \n           between two separated and warring parents. Their               \n           friendship and their break-up embody the story of French       \n           cinema.                                                        \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Anouk Aime................ : ..Herself (archive footage)      \n           Jean-Pierre Aumont......... : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Charles Aznavour........... : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Jean-Paul Belmondo......... : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Jacqueline Bisset.......... : ..Herself (archive footage)      \n           Jean-Claude Brialy......... : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Claude Chabrol............. : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Jean Cocteau............... : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Raoul Coutard.............. : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Jean Desailly.............. : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Marie Dubois............... : ..Herself (archive footage)      \n           Jean-Luc Godard............ : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n           Chantal Goya............... : ..Herself (archive footage)      \n           Claude Jade................ : ..Herself (archive footage)      \n           Anna Karina................ : ..Herself (archive footage)      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n           Hybrid source kept at 29fps to keep all valid frames from        \n                            diferent old footages.                          \n                   Thanks to our friends at SADPANDA.
