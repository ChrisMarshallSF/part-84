Press Conference, Americana Hotel. 05-14-1968\n2. WNET Newsfront. taped 05-14-1968, aired 05-15-1968\n3. The Tonight Show. 05-14-1968\n4. David Frost Presents... Paul McCartney with Mary Hopkin, London, 06-16-1968\n\n\nApple, you may recall, was meant to be the BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and in a way, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s --\ncreative playground. It was to be a manifestly non-corporate place where artists and\ndreamers could find the support for projects that establishment companies turned down.\nAnd in a small way, for the briefest time, it was. Its record division got off to a promising\nstart with Mary Hopkin, Badfinger, the Modern Jazz Quartet, James Taylor and the\ncomposer John Tavener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not a bad roster. Apple Films produced the weird cult classic El\nTopo. And okay, so Magic AlexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s electronics division ran mainly on fumes and\nhemorrhaged money ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it was a great concept.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was, of course, long before Apple became what it is today -- one of the\nworldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading employers of attorneys, barristers, solicitors and lawyers, creatures Apple\nhas unleashed unsparingly, like the bulldogs in the scene recently restored to Yellow\nSubmarine, on everything from similarly named computer companies, Broadway\nmusicals, fans who hoped to celebrate the Beatles on their websites, and scholars working\non books about the group and its music.\nBut let us forget all that for an hour or so, and look back to the halcyon days when\nApple was a fresh, pure and wonderfully naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve idea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis CD begins with a few important mementos of John LennonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and Paul\nMcCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s May 1968 visit to New York to announce their new company. The first is a\nreconstruction of the May 14 press conference, compiled from excerpts broadcast on\nWABC radio, with additions from The Compleat Beatles and The Beatles Anthology\nstitched in when they were more complete than the WABC versions, or included material\nthat WABC didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t air at all.\nThe two major appearances of the week ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Newsfront interview, from WNET\ntelevision, and the visit to The Tonight Show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are included in their entirety. And filling\nout the disc is an appearance by McCartney, with protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Mary Hopkin, on David Frost Presents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1\n\n01. Press Conference (10:22)\n02.
