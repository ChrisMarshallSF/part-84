It is easy to miss because it occurs during the dark starfield pan, but when it is visible on certain displays, it is a mess!\n \nI have already begun re-encoding all three versions of the movie (AVI, MKV and DVD). If you are still the only seeder, it might be prudent to cancel the torrent until I can upload a replacement. Otherwise, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to be a lot of confused and disappointed downloaders.\n \nI am so sorry for this snag; and I am very appreciative of your efforts to share the work with the torrent community.\n \n- AM\n \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSorry about this. I have deleted the torrent with the defective file, and ASAP will upload the corrected file torrent.\n\n------- HalOfBorg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8218982f526239397238ff3d13bc192b0969b88","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Regeneration+%282011%29+-+TORENT+INFORMATION.txt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8218982f526239397238ff3d13bc192b0969b88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,33,137,130,245,38,35,147,151,35,143,243,209,59,193,146,176,150,155,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
