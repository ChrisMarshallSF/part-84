Learn whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at the root of AlanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pain that brings her to tears. Can she finally learn to be at peace? Then, if your husband cheated, how much would you want to know about his mistress? After months of agonizing over her husbandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s affair, Jennifer is faced with a decision: see the woman her husband cheated with, or put it out of her mind for good. Will Jennifer be able to look at the photos, or will the pain be too much to bear? Next, emotions pour out as Gloria and Alana face off. Will they finally be able to put the past behind them? Plus, find out why Dr. Phil gives Alana $10,000, and why she canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but stir up more drama by excluding one of the Housewives from a big charity fashion show.
