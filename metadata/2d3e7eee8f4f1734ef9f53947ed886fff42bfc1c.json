See       \n         Alexandria and Cairo, go inside the pyramids     \n         at Giza, explore the chambers and tombs in the   \n         Valley of the Kings, and discover why Egypt s    \n         culture is bound to the river and its            \n         creatures specifically the crocodile god,        \n         Sobek.

Seeking      \n          Sobek For millions of years, crocodiles         \n          washed into the lives of Egyptians during the   \n         Niles annual flood, striking fear, awe and       \n         death. But, as the population of man grew        \n         along the river, the Lord of the Nile slowly     \n         disappeared. Now that there are reports that     \n         crocodiles are making a return in the south of   \n         Egypt, Richard Bangs hopes to catch a glimpse    \n         of Sobek. A Pioneer Richard Bangs has spent      \n          more than 30 years as an explorer, and is a     \n         pioneer in travel that makes a difference. In    \n         fact, Expedia.com founder Rich Barton called     \n         him Indiana Jones with a conscience.
