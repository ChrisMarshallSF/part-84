Simple as that.\nSuper Scribblenauts:\nAnother game.\n\nIf you want me to upload other games, i will most certainly do that for you.\nIf it doesn't work on Desmume (i'll check), then I will put up an emulator that the specific game works on.\n\nIf you have any questions, don't hesitate to comment below.\n\nThanks for considering this download,\nGhettoGarden1 (GG-852)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86f404326631b4fe84cc5a0a0c62af72ae66bdd","amp;dn":"Desmume+and+Emulator+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86f404326631b4fe84cc5a0a0c62af72ae66bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,111,64,67,38,99,27,79,232,76,197,160,160,198,42,247,42,230,107,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
