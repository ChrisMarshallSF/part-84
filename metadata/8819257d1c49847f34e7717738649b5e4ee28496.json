The song is the sixth track on the album A Kind of Magic, released in June 1986, and was written by guitarist Brian May for the soundtrack to the film Highlander, directed by Russell Mulcahy. The song peaked at No 24 in the British charts.\n\nThe song is used to frame the scenes in the film where Connor MacLeod must endure his beloved wife Heather growing old and dying while he, as an Immortal, remains forever young. (It was later used in the episodes &quot;The Gathering&quot;, &quot;Revenge is Sweet&quot;, &quot;The Hunters&quot;, &quot;Line of Fire&quot;, and &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; of the Highlander television series.) The song's title is taken from a line in another movie scored by Brian May and Queen, Flash Gordon (the line can be heard on Battle Theme from Queen Flash Gordon soundtrack album).\n\nMay sings lead vocals on the first verse, before Freddie Mercury takes over for most of the rest of the song, with May singing &quot;But touch my tears with your lips&quot; during Mercury's verse and then the final line of the song, &quot;Who waits forever anyway?&quot;. The version which can be heard in the film is unique, in that it features Mercury singing lead vocals on the first verse. Mercury also sang the lead in live performances. When live, however, the song was lowered by a whole tone, and Mercury would frequently alter the song's highly demanding vocal line due to the strain placed on his voice by vocal nodules: this often involved Roger Taylor handling lead vocals on the choruses, while Mercury harmonised with a counter-melody. An instrumental version of the song, titled &quot;Forever&quot;, was included as a bonus track on the CD version of the album. This instrumental featured only a piano, with keyboard accompaniment during the chorus sections. The piano track was recorded solely by Brian May. Queen was backed up by an orchestra, with orchestrations by the co-composer of the film's score, Michael Kamen.\n\n\nLyrics for the movie\n--------------------\nThere's no time for us\nThere's no place for us\nWhat is this thing that builds our dreams yet slips away\nFrom us\n\nWho wants to live forever\nWho wants to live forever....?\n\nThere's no chance for us\nIts all decided for us\nThis world has only one sweet moment set aside for us\n\nWho wants to live forever\nWho wants to live forever?\n\nWho dares to love forever?\nWhen love must die\n\n...................................................................................\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player\n                       (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC.\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
