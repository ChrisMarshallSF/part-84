Not that there was anything wrong with the previous torrent, it's just that this one is a little better.\n\nThis torrent contains the same episodes from the same broadcasts as the previous torrent (episodes 1,3,4,5,6 are 25fps while 2,7,8 are 29.70) as these are still the best combination of quality v low station logo annoyance episodes I could find. However after uploading the previous torrent I stumbled across copies of a couple of episodes which I didn't think existed, so while I was encoding newer 720p versions of those, I improved all of them and also re-encoded these AVIs.\n\nThese are probably the highest quality AVI copies available. They're much better quality than the 350MB per episode torrents and they're better quality than the 700MB per episode versions.\n\n-I ran a mild sharpening filter on these while encoding them this time so they look better than the AVIs in my previous torrent.\n-All of the promo intros and outros (where the promo breaks would have been) have now been removed, so all episodes should just play straight through.\n-I fixed the luminance level of episode 4 (Stars). I don't know how I missed it originally, but space is now black instead of dark grey. I'm pretty sure it was broadcast that way for some reason, but I'm also sure it was wrong.\n-Each episode was once again encoded for quality, not file size, so the file sizes vary accordingly. All should be playable using any standalone player.\n\nAll episodes are 704x400 XviD with CBR 128k MP3 audio.\n\nAs I spent a bit of time on these AVIs, when running them side by side with the 720p encodes on my monitors (full screen), the quality difference isn't all that great. If you'd prefer the 720p copies however, you can find them here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6140696/How_The_Universe_Works_-_720p_%28Discovery_2010%29_Improved_Version&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6140696/How_The_Universe_Works_-_720p_%28Discovery_2010%29_Improved_Version&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy upload speed is still rather slow, so please be patient while I seed.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e44d639fad163a50c2c326bd838126c8719d8e03","amp;dn":"How+The+Universe+Works+-+XviD+%28Discovery+2010%29+Improved+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e44d639fad163a50c2c326bd838126c8719d8e03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,77,99,159,173,22,58,80,194,195,38,189,131,129,38,200,113,157,142,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
