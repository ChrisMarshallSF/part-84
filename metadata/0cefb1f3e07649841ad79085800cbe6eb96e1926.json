Cohen) grew up in a happy family and had a great and active childhood. Initially, she started her working life in a beauty salon before the outbreak of war inspired her to move to London and join the weapon industry. It didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take too long for her to be noticed by the secret services, as she was beautiful, athletic and had great attention to detail, and so she was soon recruited into Secret Intelligence Service during BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s darkest hours. Violette had lost an aunt during one of the first Luftwaffe bombing attacks and to further compound her heartache she later lost her RAF husband in battle. However, Summer was strong willed and used these painful experiences to inspire her to succeed as a spy for the SIS.\n\nA highly tactical stealth game, this isn't COD. You can't run in guns blazing here. (Not that you even start out with a gun.) You need to be smart about your kills and plan your move accordingly. Great gameplay, takes more brains than playing Assassin's Creed IMO.
