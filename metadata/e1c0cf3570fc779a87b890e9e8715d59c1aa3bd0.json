Al Jarreau recorded an entire CD of Withers' songs on Tribute to Bill Withers (Culture Press 1998). His popular radio-aired LP track from Still Bill, &quot;Who Is He? (And What Is He to You?),&quot; was a 1974 R&amp;B hit for Creative Source.\n\nBorn July 4, 1938, in Slab Fork, WV, Withers was the youngest of six children. His father died when he was a child and he was raised by his mother and grandmother. After a nine-year stint in the Navy, Withers moved to Los Angeles to pursue a music career in 1967. He recorded demos at night while working at the Boeing aircraft company where he made toilet seats. His recording career began after being introduced to Clarence Avant, president of Sussex Records. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Lovely Day\n02.I Want To Spend The Night\n03.Let Me Be The One You Need\n04.Hello Like Before\n05.Tender Things\n06.I Wish You Well\n07.Ain't No Sunshine\n08.Grandma's Hands\n09.The Same Love That Made Me Laugh\n10.Lean On Me (Single Version)\n11.Harlem\n12.Use Me (Single Version)\n13.Who Is He (And What Is He To You?)\n14.You Just Can't Smile It Away\n15.Just The Two Of Us (Duet With Grover Washington, Jr.)\n16.Steppin' Right Along\n17.You Try To Find A Love\n18.My Imagination\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n          ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1c0cf3570fc779a87b890e9e8715d59c1aa3bd0","amp;dn":"Bill+Withers+-+The+Best+Of+Lean+On+Me+%282000%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1c0cf3570fc779a87b890e9e8715d59c1aa3bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,192,207,53,112,252,119,154,135,184,144,233,232,113,93,89,193,170,59,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
