ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn contrast to todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 24/7 politicians who have neither the time nor the talent to cultivate their hinterlands, Churchill did so all his life with extraordinary energy, imagination and versatility,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said Sir David. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI do not think that many of us appreciate the full dimensions of his personality and his genius.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAnd the extraordinary range of that personality and genius is perhaps best illustrated by his skill at the humble art of bricklaying. Churchill was a qualified member of the Amalgamated Union of Bricklayers and at Chartwell, his home in Kent, he laid a superb red brick wall around the vegetable garden with a trowel in one hand and a cigar in the other. He also built a swimming pool and a goldfish pond.\n\nBricklaying was only one of his many interests and the first signs of that rich and varied life were not as a builder but at Harrow school. There his achievements were not academic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ when it came to brains he would later describe himself as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlate developerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but rather as a swimmer for the school and at the age of 17 as the British Public SchoolsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ fencing champion.\n\n\nChurchill's Other Lives - 01 - Bricklaying \nChurchill's Other Lives - 02 - Appetite \nChurchill's Other Lives - 03 - Journalist \nChurchill's Other Lives - 04 - Son And Father \nChurchill's Other Lives - 05 - Women \nChurchill's Other Lives - 06 - Cinema \nChurchill's Other Lives - 07 - Money \nChurchill's Other Lives - 08 - Painting \nChurchill's Other Lives - 09 - Horses \nChurchill's Other Lives - 10 - Religion \n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 12mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2881a0a3b70505c26f3251d1e1550db2417cc4c5","amp;dn":"Churchill%5C%27s+Other+Lives+-+Audio+Documentary+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2881a0a3b70505c26f3251d1e1550db2417cc4c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,129,160,163,183,5,5,194,111,50,81,209,225,85,13,178,65,124,196,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
