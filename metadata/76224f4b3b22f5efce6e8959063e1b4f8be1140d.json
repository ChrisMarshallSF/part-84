This was compiled from hours and hours of research, both on the internet and from the companion. I spent a lot of time searching threads and picking out stellar versions of songs from each year. 1984-2000 section will be comprised mainly of AUD's, (98% being the top AUD circulating) with some SBD versions thrown in. 2003-2011 will be SBD quality.\n\nAlso, remember that the quality improves dramatically throughout. The 1980's is obv. a bit rough but the recordings do get much better.\n\n-Created by PhantasyTour's jamhead99&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76224f4b3b22f5efce6e8959063e1b4f8be1140d","amp;dn":"Phish%5C%27d+Out%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76224f4b3b22f5efce6e8959063e1b4f8be1140d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,34,79,75,59,34,245,239,206,110,137,89,6,62,27,79,139,225,20,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
