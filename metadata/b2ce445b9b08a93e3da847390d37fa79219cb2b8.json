It was released in early 1999 on Columbia Records following the band's move from American Recordings. Second guitarist Marc Ford and bassist Johnny Colt had left The Black Crowes in 1997; for By Your Side, Rich Robinson played all the guitar parts and Sven Pipien was hired as the band's new bassist. The album was recorded in New York City in the second quarter of 1998 and produced by Kevin Shirley. By Your Side comprised songs written in the studio, reworked songs from pre-production and some holdovers from the shelved album Band (1997).\nThe album debuted at its peak position of number 26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. While some critics depreciated By Your Side for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990).\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
