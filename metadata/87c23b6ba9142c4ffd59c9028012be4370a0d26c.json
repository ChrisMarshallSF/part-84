Features the twelve and a half minute misanthropic epic Ill At Ease, and fire and brimstone favorite Glory Amen.\n\nThose Poor Bastards play miserable and primitive old-time gothic country music. Lonesome Wyatt (guitar, vocals) and The Minister (banjo, bass, etc.) are both legally certified holiness preachers.\n\nIf you\\'re looking for slick, over-produced, commercial songs, you\\'d better cover your delicate little ears. Those Poor Bastards play it raw and they play it mean. Be a pal and support independent anti-corporate country music.\n\nThose Poor Bastards are the best Gothic Country I have heard yet to this day. The depressing gloomy vocals coming out of this drifter named Lonesome Wyatt has hints of Marilyn Manson to Nick Cave, Throwrag and maybe even a hint of a demented Adam Ant with a shot of a Pilled Up Johnny Cash... And the Minister is backing up Lonesome Wyatt with a style that is a cross between erie strung out folk music with a creepy blend of The Nightmare Before Christmas!!!!!!!!! \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Williams III\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c23b6ba9142c4ffd59c9028012be4370a0d26c","amp;dn":"Those+Poor+Bastards+-+Gospel+Haunted+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c23b6ba9142c4ffd59c9028012be4370a0d26c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,194,59,107,169,20,44,79,253,89,201,2,128,18,190,67,112,160,210,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
