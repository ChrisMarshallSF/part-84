At that time it had been still named HOUSEbar. Their interest in electronic music was born performing at various events and parties, but above all, it was during in their Mediterranean Sea vacation together on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRave &amp; Cruise.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At that point, the first joint events were planned and in the works. The first sound that DJ Knitram and DJ Nyana produced was on the 1st of May 2002, which gave the start to the progressive life of AM-Concept. In 2002, they were confronted with progressive music. With that inspiration, they really got the feeling for this type of the music. Over the years, they put their stamp on their type of music and came up with their own deep progressive sound. At the same time they were influenced by notable producers and DJÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s like Tarkan, Sultan and Facundo Mohrr. Their expertise was also being appreciated abroad, such as in Poland and Austria. You cannot compare their sound with well known house and trance music, you cannot describe sound, it just gets under your skin and you really start to feel sound. What are you waiting for? Check out their website and let their sound create goosebumps for you! more:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b89d3d869f9635ec12db0d3e80cab88f8e4e67ee","amp;dn":"AM-Concept+-+Aru+%28Roman+Fliedl+Feelings+Remix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b89d3d869f9635ec12db0d3e80cab88f8e4e67ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,157,61,134,159,150,53,236,18,219,13,62,128,202,184,143,142,78,103,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
