Overlaying a romantic triangle on the basic premise was \na later development. The original inspiration for director Stefan Schwartz \nand his co-writer Richard Holmes came from stories about the notorious Kray brothers. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRich had a friend who knew someone whose brotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sister was a driver for the Krays \nand had some neat scam stories,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Schwartz. \n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShooting FishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was made on the inevitably tight budget where imagination counts \nfor more than the power of cash. Shot all over London on dozens of different \nlocations, the main set is the interior of a gasometer where Dylan and Jez \nlive rent free away from prying eyes. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want it to be straight reality, \nI donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want it to be gritty realism. This is about two unemployed people in \nLondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want it to be grey housing blocks and deeply depressing. \nI want it to be sunny and bright and colourful and energetic,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Schwartz explains. \nThe other challenge is to keep up the energy with the endless series of scams \nthat the trio attempt. At one point they sell the same batch of insulation \nto every house in a row of terraces. The real bonus in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShooting FishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nturns out to be Kate Beckinsale who is better known for her appearances in \nperiod films such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMuch Ado About NothingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the television version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEmmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \nJudging by the success of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Full MontyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Wedding SingerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to name just \ntwo recent comedies, we have a healthy appetite for films that make us laugh. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShooting FishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have their broad appeal but it has a charm of its own \nand it is certainly different from the typical contemporary British product. \nStefan SchwartzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first feature ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoft Top, Hard ShoulderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ won awards including \nbest Scottish film of the year. With ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShooting FishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he has produced a film big \non heart and as light as a feather. \n----------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e02520a37c6061d0c6f01cc60396df916b7ab483","amp;dn":"Shooting+Fish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e02520a37c6061d0c6f01cc60396df916b7ab483","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,37,32,163,124,96,97,208,198,240,28,198,3,150,223,145,107,122,180,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
