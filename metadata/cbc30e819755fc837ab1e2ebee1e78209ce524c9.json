Dr. Kim, who cautions against a possible mega-tsunami at Haeundae, collapses in agony springing from an unexpected turn-up of his daughter and divorced wife. Hyoung-sik, after rescuing a woman from Seoul, rides out a ferocious storm to gladden her heart. A tsunami which destroys Haeundae symbolizes the establishment of a typical axis called provocation of conflicts, and later the inner spaces of the couples without anything left behind after all conflicts have ended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbc30e819755fc837ab1e2ebee1e78209ce524c9","amp;dn":"Tidal+Wave+2009+DVDRip.XViD.AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbc30e819755fc837ab1e2ebee1e78209ce524c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,195,14,129,151,85,252,131,122,177,226,235,238,30,120,32,156,229,36,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
