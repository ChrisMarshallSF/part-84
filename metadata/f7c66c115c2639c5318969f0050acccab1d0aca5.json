I have applied the 8 year crash fix, and removed the copy protection form the game.\n\nI have added my save game: club Manchester United end of season 2009. You can continue from here if you wish....(There's your proof!).\n\nI am running the game on Windows XP SP2 and my graphics card is Nvidia Geforce 8400 GS.\n\nSo there you have it!  So what are  you waiting for? Get managing now!!!\n\n\nAbout USM 98\n------------\nFollowing on the footsteps of its predecessor, USM 98 brings the series to a new level while keeping the same presentation and style characteristic of the series.\n\nThe biggest change when compared to USM 2 is the implementation of all leagues in the same executable, which allow players to jump between England (all five nationwide leagues), Scotland (four), Germany (both Bundeslligas and the Regionaliga), Spain, France and Italy (two divisions each). Signings were also changed, and now require a number of faxes between the clubs and the player, which can delay a transfer by two weeks. Players now also have positions, defined by skills. A player with high tackling is a defender, both high tackling and passing is a defensive midfielder, and so on. By intensive training a player can be adapted successfully to a new position, and there's also a favorite side, which makes the difference between an attacking midfielder and a winger. On the downside, players no longer have a personality trait. With the exception of the player's potential (which defines the speed a player, particularly young, increases his abilities), everything can be edited using the in-game editor.\n\nThe rest of the game remained mostly unchanged, from the interface, composed by static pictures of several offices where options are reached by clicking on hotspots (like a TV for the teletext, where in-depth statistics can be consulted) to the financial options, where the player is given the lot of land close to the stadium to build stores for both marketing and merchandising. \n\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/ultimate-soccer-manager-98/screenshots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/ultimate-soccer-manager-98/screenshots&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHow To Install The Game:\nExtract the self-extracting archive to folder of your choice eg., C:\\\nOpen the \\USM 98 XP-Hyperdrive25 folder and click on USM98.exe.\n\nStat Editor: if you want to edit the USM 98 database you can click on\nSTATEDIT.EXE. This will let you change the stats for the players etc,. etc,. \n\n...................................................................................\n\nComment by Hyperdrive: This is the very first soccer management game I began with.\nFrom there onwards I went to play Total Club Manager 05, Fifa manager 09, 07, 08\nFifa Manager 2010 and 2011.\n\nUSM 98 IS still the best mamagement game for me. I wish the guys at Sierra had worked more on it....(but alas! this is life! all good things come to an end!) \n...................................................................................\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
