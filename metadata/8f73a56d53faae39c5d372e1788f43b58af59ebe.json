The central figure in the film is Irish-American Paul Brennan, a 56-year-old of great wit who traipses door to door in an effort to sell the good book to Catholic housewives who really can't afford to buy but don't want to appear rude to a Church-sanctioned representative. The documentary, a collaboration by the Maysles brothers, also follows Brennan as he shares war stories with fellow Bible peddlers and attends management and sales meetings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f73a56d53faae39c5d372e1788f43b58af59ebe","amp;dn":"Salesman+%5B%2BExtras%5D+%281968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f73a56d53faae39c5d372e1788f43b58af59ebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,115,165,109,83,250,174,57,197,211,114,225,120,143,67,181,138,245,158,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
