He            \n         patiently earned the trust of a matriarch named Echo and      \n         her offspring and, with that trust, privileged glimpses       \n         into the most intimate moments of their lives. Colbeck        \n         has captured nothing less than a stirring family saga         \n         spanning generations, including poignant births and deaths,   \n         carefree play and ferocious fights, reluctant partings        \n         and joyous reunions - even every mother's worst nightmare,    \n          the kidnapping of her baby.                                   \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                          ORENJI, 2HD, DHD, CTU                        \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
