Eventually a single     \n         man was caught and convicted in one of the       \n         largest manhunts in our nation's history. Ever   \n         since the case has been closed until four        \n         years later two reporters investigate charges    \n         that the original investigation was filled       \n         with errors and tainted evidence. They seek to   \n         find the truth behind the Atlanta Child          \n         Murders.                                         \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                       \n                               \n                   \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n     ASPECT &amp; STANDARD  AUDiO \n                                                                     \n         [*] Fullscreen  4:3        [*] English                        \n         [ ] Widescreen 16:9        [ ] Dutch      [ ] DTS 6.1         \n          [25.000] Framerate         [ ] French     [ ] DS 5.1           \n         [576x432 ] Resolution      [ ] German     [*] DS 2.0          \n                                    [ ] Spanish    [ ] DS 2.0 MONO     \n                                    [ ] Other                          \n                                                                       \n                                    [mp3@128kbps 48khz ]               \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n      SUBTiTLES  \n                                                                     \n       [ ] English     [ ] Swedish     [ ] Spanish     [ ] Dutch       \n       [ ] Danish      [ ] German      [ ] Polish      [ ] Italian     \n       [ ] Arabic      [ ] Bulgarian   [ ] Czech       [ ] Greek       \n        [ ] Hindi       [ ] Hungarian   [ ] Croatic     [ ] Romenian     \n       [ ] Slovenia    [ ] Turkish     [ ] Icelandic   [ ] Finnish     \n       [ ] Norwegian   [ ] French      [ ] Hebrew      [ ] Other       \n                                                       [*] None        \n                                                                       \n     ViDEO  MENU  DVD-EXTRAS \n                                                                     \n        [ ] Untouched       [ ] Untouched      [ ] Untouched           \n        [*] Re-encoded      [*] Stripped       [*] Stripped            \n        [2] Passes                             [ ] Partial Stripped    \n        [892 ] Bitrate                         [ ] Re-encoded          \n                                               [0] Passes              \n                                                                     \n      Rippers Notes  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Enjoy!                                                            \n                                                                       \n       Note: HQ sites needed: see contact info plz!                      \n                                                                       \n                                               \n                                               \n                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n         Greetz to everyone helping out the BD WMV and DVDR scene!     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Special greetz to: NOVO INSECTS XPDVD XPD SPiCE SMeG THUGLiNE     \n                       Start2 QwiiF XorCist WiiLP RAP XPRESS           \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                     R.I.P.
