With his family home up for\n                sale and his teenage son Nick refusing to take his\n                calls, Monroe throws himself into his job, tackling\n                life at the hospital with his usual energy and\n                humour. When an ex-soldier is admitted with a blood\n                clot in his brain, Monroe takes the controversial\n                decision to avoid surgery. As he comes under\n                increasing pressure to operate, will his 'wait and\n                see' approach be the right one? Meanwhile, will\n                Bremner break her own rule and let emotion get in the\n                way of her clinical instincts?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f14b9696c242b9ecbc0609057296605590dfbf","amp;dn":"Monroe.S01E03.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f14b9696c242b9ecbc0609057296605590dfbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,241,75,150,150,194,66,185,236,188,6,9,5,114,150,96,85,144,223,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
