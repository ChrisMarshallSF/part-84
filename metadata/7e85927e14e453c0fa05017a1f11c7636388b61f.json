He is considered a troubadour in the tradition of Townes Van Zandt, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Dave Carter. He delivers his songs with a quiet power, informed by a complex understanding of humanity. In the Spring 2008 issue of Sing Out! magazine, journalist Matt Watroba noted that Schmidt's arrangements are powerful, his performances are laid-back yet energetic, while his lyrics are sheer poetry.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Schmidt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
