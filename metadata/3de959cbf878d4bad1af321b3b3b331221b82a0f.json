Still shocked by\n                Coburn's revelation, Joe insists that he must come\n                clean before someone else does it for him. A chance\n                encounter with drug user Angie makes Coburn reassess\n                his attitude to street crime, and he realises that\n                many of the community's problems have the same root:\n                Jake Little. Judge Coburn and Father Jim finally\n                start to talk about the past, and Coburn makes a\n                shocking discovery. A stand-off between Sharna and\n                Jake Little reveals some surprising news.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                The rules for naming releases don't state what to do\n                when there are two series that are from the same\n                country and also the same year.
