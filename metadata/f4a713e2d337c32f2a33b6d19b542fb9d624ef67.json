Their music looks back to Unrest and Teenage Fanclub and shares contemporary shelf space with Death Cab for Cutie and the California Oranges, with whom Desario share members. Mike Carr's poppy bass lines on tracks like &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Fine Time&quot; provide the momentum, but it's Desario's overall commitment to nothing more complicated than pure pop pleasure that cinches their appeal.\n\nReleased: 2009\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: 192k/b\nCodec: mp3\n\nTrack list:\n1 - Nautical Ways\n2 - Late Sedan\n3 - Cane Cola\n4 - Fine Time\n5 - Drama Club\n6 - Smile With Your Mouth Closed\n7 - Houston\n8 - Rain and Gold\n9 - As I Recall\n10 - Sequoia Gee\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a713e2d337c32f2a33b6d19b542fb9d624ef67","amp;dn":"Desario+-+Zero+Point+Zero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a713e2d337c32f2a33b6d19b542fb9d624ef67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,167,19,226,211,55,195,47,42,51,182,209,155,84,47,185,214,36,239,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
