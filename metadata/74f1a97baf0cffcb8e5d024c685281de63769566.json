JP, former member of Hand Me Down Buick, had completed a full-length album with the national touring act, but after returning from a successful Warped Tour he was led in a different direction. After 3 years with Hand Me Down Buick, JP went back to his roots and started writing his own songs. Working with producer Anthony Santonocito, he produced a full- band, full-length LP titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Hung Up.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\nUpon completion of the record, JP relocated to New York City to put his own band together, beginning with accomplished bassist Jamie Pitrelli. Jamie, who has studied with the likes of Danny Miranda (Blue Oyster Cult, Queen), Chris Altenhoff (Queen V, Trans-Siberian Orchestra) and Conrad Korch (Rod Stewart), came to New York City to continue his musical education at Hunter College. He has played numerous sessions and gigs with various bands and artists including We Love Radio, Half The Sky, Dave Eggar of Trans-Siberian Orchesta, and L2. After meeting JP and bonding over musical influences, Jamie listened to the album and quickly became an indispensable part of the project.\n\nThe two began scouting possible drummers, and soon found Leo Freire. A senior in the Macaulay Honors Program at Hunter College as a Music and Economics double major, Leo has been playing the drums for about 9 years. Born in Brazil, Leo brought a new diversity to the group, having played in bands of various genres such as HaakonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fault (Progressive Rock/ Funk), Makeshift Lullaby (Pop/ Rock), and Going to Another Galaxy (Avantgarde/ Jazz).\n\nNext to come on board was Sean Salant, who frequently played with Jamie and Leo and could match their high caliber of musicianship and professionalism. Sean, born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, had played many gigs in the NYC area starting in high school with the thrash metal band Name Your Poison. He also toured with the rock band Mobius, and Teagan Taylor Trio, playing everything from jazz concerts in small clubs to big beach celebrations in the San Diego area.\n\nTying it all together is Tom Senatore Jr. who has studied guitar with Colin Biedermann, the namesake of a memorial scholarship for the Center for Improvisational Music and School for Improvisational Music. Tom has participated in various bands throughout his high school career, and met Jamie when he was admitted to the music program at Hunter College. Given the opportunity, Tom jumped at the chance to join the talented group.\n\nWith all the pieces now in place, Mostly Coats officially formed at the beginning of 2011. The new lineup: JP Keeler on lead vocals, Jamie Pitrelli on bass, Leo Freire on drums, and Sean Salant &amp; Tom Senatore on guitar. Their unparalleled musicianship, enthusiasm, focus, and drive is making Mostly Coats an unstoppable force in the NYC music scene. With a scheduled release date of March 8th, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHung UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is destined to wow fans of acts such as Paramore, Panic! at the Disco, New Found Glory, and My Chemical Romance. Watch for it on iTunes as well as other popular digital and physical distributors!\n\nVISIT MOSTLY COATS ONLINE:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f1a97baf0cffcb8e5d024c685281de63769566","amp;dn":"Mostly+Coats+-+Hung+Up+%282011+Pop%2FRock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f1a97baf0cffcb8e5d024c685281de63769566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,241,169,123,175,12,255,203,142,93,2,76,104,82,129,222,99,118,149,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
