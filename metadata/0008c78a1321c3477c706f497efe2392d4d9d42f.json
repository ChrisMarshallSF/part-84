By including these junk\nheaders they are making their releases unplayable in some standalone players without\nremuxing. Included in /PROOF are pictures of what happens when you try to play their\nreleases in the Phillips DV642. The files are renamed due to the 8 character name restriction\n\nIf you simply remux the file in Vdub, the result will be 1mb smaller and play perfectly fine\nhowever there is no reason to be padding releases and causing incompatibilities with playback\n\nWe thought this practice was done away with. Guess we were too hopeful. Enjoy thisworking\nrelease. Oh and lastly, how about cutting the end a bit better, it looks like it's missing something\nbut it's not\n\n**Yes we know the pictures are sucky quality but they do the job and yes we expect to be nuked\nbut ASAP already got nuked on this issue the other day and then unnuked but obviously the problem\nisn't fixed **\n\nSHORT: junk.header.data.causes.issues.with.standalone.playback","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0008c78a1321c3477c706f497efe2392d4d9d42f","amp;dn":"Smallville.S10E13.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-2HD-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0008c78a1321c3477c706f497efe2392d4d9d42f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,8,199,138,19,33,195,71,124,112,111,73,126,254,35,146,212,217,212,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
