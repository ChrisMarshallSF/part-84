Since college, confirmed bachelor Ronny (Vaughn) and happily married Nick (James) have been through thick and thin. Now partners in an auto design firm, the two pals are vying to land a dream project that would launch their company. Ronny's girlfriend, Beth (Connelly), and Nick's wife, Geneva (Ryder), are by their sides. But Ronny's world is turned upside down when he inadvertently sees Geneva out with another man and makes it his mission to get answers. As the amateur investigation dissolves into mayhem, he learns that Nick has a few secrets of his own. Now, with the clock ticking and pressure mounting on the biggest presentation of their careers, Ronny must decide what will happen if he reveals the truth to his best friend.\n\n\nUsers: 4.9/10 (2,517 votes) 42 reviews | Critics: 124 reviews Metascore: 46/100 (based on 32 reviews from Metacritic.com)\n\n\nDirector:\nRon Howard\nWriter:\nAllan Loeb\nStars:\nVince Vaughn, Kevin James and Winona Ryder\n\n\nVIDEO: Jailbait...
