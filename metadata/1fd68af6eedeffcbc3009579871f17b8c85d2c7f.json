Deva is apparently a Hindu devotee who is bent upon teaching Bhagavad Gita to every human he meets. Anjali happens to see an accident in which a bunch of goons die. She takes this opportunity to create a fictional character called 'Azad'. She writes a letter that Azad has done this assassination to end the rowdy deeds in the city. Word spread like wildfire that there is a guy called 'Azad' who is the protector of the common man. Soundarya takes more opportunities to popularize the character of 'Azad'. There is a humble guy called Chandra Sekhar Azad (Akkineni Nagarjuna) in Rajahmundry who has a widowed mother, a beautiful sister and a cute maradalu, Kanaka Mahalakshmi (Shilpa Shetty) to take care of. As his sister's marriage is fixed, Azaad goes to Hyderabad to get the five lakhs he saved in a chit fund company. There he happens to be involved in a few bomb blasting incidents and avoids all the bomb blasts without his knowledge. People start to think that he is the &quot;Azaad&quot;. Anjali meets him and explains him about her mission of ending nonsense in the city. , who is more interested in retrieving money from Chitfund Company and going back to Rajahmundry to participate in his sister's marriage refuses to enact the role of legendary character Azaad. But later on the chitfund company turns out to be bogus. By looking at victims of the chitfund company committing suicide, Azaad wears the mask of 'Azad' to stop corruption in the city. All these incidents make Deva feel disturbed. Azad also comes to know that Deva is not a Hindu, but a Muslim terrorist who is in a mission to destroy India. And the rest of the film is about how Azaad assassinates Deva and his gang of goons.\n\nFile info\n\nFile size                        : 699 MiB\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.40:1\n\nAudio Format                      : AAC\nBit rate                         : 64 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\n\nRipper  :Reaper\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tamilcreation.com/forum/showthread.php?79091-DvDRip-Azad-2000-MP4-1CD-TamilCreation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tamilcreation.com/forum/showthread.php?79091-DvDRip-Azad-2000-MP4-1CD-TamilCreation&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd68af6eedeffcbc3009579871f17b8c85d2c7f","amp;dn":"%5BDvDRip%5D+Azad+2000+MP4+1CD+%5BTamilCreation%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd68af6eedeffcbc3009579871f17b8c85d2c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,214,138,246,238,222,255,203,195,0,149,121,135,31,23,184,200,93,44,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
