Unpack the ISO files from the RAR files, burn on DVDs and play! (you need a modchip or SwapMagic to play it on ps2). \nYes, I really managed to compress 3,5GB ISO file (DW5) to 47MB RAR, but I haven't got that luck with DW5XL.\n\nP.S. - I noticed that there isn't a torrent for the game Dynasty Warriors 5 Xtreme Legends - PAL version, so I've decided to create it, plus add the DW5 game into it. \n\nP.P.S. - To be able to add features from DW5XL to DW5, you need both games to be PAL or both to be NTSC. The games in this torrent are both PAL, so they are fully compatible.\n\nDon't forget to seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16616c752abd5bac63a10f29bdf8b7f204b2edd6","amp;dn":"Dynasty+Warriors+5+%2B+Dynasty+Warriors+5+Xtreme+Legends+%5BPAL%5D+%5BPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16616c752abd5bac63a10f29bdf8b7f204b2edd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,97,108,117,42,189,91,172,99,161,15,41,189,248,183,242,4,178,237,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
