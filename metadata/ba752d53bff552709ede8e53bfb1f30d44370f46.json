The story starts with her as a shy, somewhat withdrawn, college student who nonetheless gets involved in a drama club. The director thinks she has talent, but some of the other performers start to get jealous of the attention he gives her. Meanwhile, a reporter investigating Sadako's spiritualist mother thinks there's something very suspicious about the young woman, and arrives on campus to confront Sadako just as a series of strange deaths start sweeping through the drama club.\n                \n\n\nReview from your friendly neighbourhood Hyperdrive25: \n-----------------------------------------------------\nAn excellent horror film and a worthy prequel, which is also a stand-alone film by its own rights. If you haven yet seen Ringu and Ring 2, this film is a good starting point for you.\n\nThis film adds a whole new dimension to the Ring saga and the character of Sadako. All the actors and actresses give a thoroughly professional performance onscreen. The special effects are not overdone in this film, which is the reason why this film is so good. In this film there is more depth to the character of Sadako who is played by \nYukie Nakama.\n\nWell, I don't want to give away any more of the plot, as you will soon see for yourself why this film is so highly rated.\n\n\n...................................................................................\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
