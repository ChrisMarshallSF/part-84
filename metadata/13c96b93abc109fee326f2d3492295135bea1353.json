Wood is an expert on international economics, globalization and finance. He was co-author of Trilaterals Over Washington Volumes I and II, with the late Antony C. Sutton.\n\nTheir highly regarded two-volume book, Trilaterals Over Washington, became a standard reference on global elitism. Wood's ongoing work is to build a knowledge center that provides a comprehensive and scholarly source of information on globalism in all its related forms: political, economic and religious.\n\nWhat is the Trilateral Commission?\n\nThe Trilateral Commission was founded by the persistent maneuvering of David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1973. Rockefeller chairman of the ultra-powerful Chase Manhattan Bank, a director of many major multinational corporations and &quot;endowment funds&quot; and had long been a central figure in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Brzezinski, a brilliant prognosticator of one-world idealism, has been a professor at Columbia University and the author of several books that have served as &quot;policy guidelines&quot; for the Trilateral Commission.\n\nBrzezinski served as the Commission's first executive director from its inception in 1973 until late 1976 when he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n\nThe initial Commission membership was approximately three hundred, with roughly one hundred each from Europe, Japan and North America. Membership was also roughly divided between academics, politicians and corporate magnates; these included international bankers, leaders of prominent labor unions and corporate directors of media giants.\n\nThe word commission was puzzling since it is usually associated with instrumentalities set up by governments. It seemed out of place with a so-called private group unless we could determine that it really was an arm of a government ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an unseen government, different from the visible government in Washington. European and Japanese involvement indicated a world government rather than a national government. We hoped that the concept of a sub-rosa world government was just wishful thinking on the part of the Trilateral Commissioners. The facts, however, lined up quite pessimistically.\n\nIf the Council on Foreign Relations could be said to be a spawning ground for the concepts of one-world idealism, then the Trilateral Commission was the &quot;task force&quot; assembled to assault the beachheads. Already the Commission had placed its members (some of whom have subsequently ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œresignedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) in the top posts the U.S. had to offer.\n\nRunning Time: 50 Minutes\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.meria.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.meria.net&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.augustreview.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.augustreview.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Trilaterals-over-Washington-Volumes-II/dp/B002LTHEL6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1301743879&amp;sr=8-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Trilaterals-over-Washington-Volumes-II/dp/B002LTHEL6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1301743879&amp;sr=8-4&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c96b93abc109fee326f2d3492295135bea1353","amp;dn":"Patrick+Wood+-+The+Secret+Trilateral+Commission","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c96b93abc109fee326f2d3492295135bea1353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,201,107,147,171,193,9,254,227,38,242,211,73,34,149,19,91,234,19,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
