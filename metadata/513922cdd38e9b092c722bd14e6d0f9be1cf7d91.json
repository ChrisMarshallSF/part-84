They've thrown down the gauntlet to send him around the globe to force him out of his comfort zone. Stephen wants the experience to broaden Karl's mind and change his outlook on the world. Ricky wants Karl to hate every minute of it for his own amusement. \n\nDespatched on what many would term a journey of a lifetime, the 'little Englander' will be putting his misgivings to one side as Karl finds out for himself what the fuss is about. He will travel to the Great Wall of China, Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen Itza in Mexico, the Taj Mahal in India and the Great Pyramids of Egypt. Meanwhile Gervais and Merchant will be keeping a watchful eye from London, monitoring every step of Pilkington's journey.\n\n\nDisc 1 of 2 from this fantastic series\n\nPLEASE SEED!\n\nIf you like it, buy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:513922cdd38e9b092c722bd14e6d0f9be1cf7d91","amp;dn":"AN_IDIOT_ABROAD_D1.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"513922cdd38e9b092c722bd14e6d0f9be1cf7d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,57,34,205,211,142,155,9,44,114,43,209,78,109,15,155,225,207,125,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
