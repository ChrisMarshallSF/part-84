But Hull seems more interested in bumper breakfast baps than smoked salmon bagels.\n\nHope and Jodie are understandably nervous as they open their new sandwich shop. As they arrive for their first day, they hope to spread a little happiness to their customers - something they could both do with a bit more of themselves too actually.\n\nIt's clear that Hope is rather at sea with this new venture, as it's the first time she has had a proper job. Recently split from her successful businessman husband, Gavin, and waiting for the divorce settlement, Hope ends up sleeping on an airbed in the spare bedroom at Jodie's house.\n\nHope and Jodie are the 'Thelma and Louise' of the sandwich world and have known each other since school, but Jodie is a workaholic and Hope an alcoholic. The duo discuss the detailed differences between a bap, a stottie cake and a bread bun - not to mention a fish cake and a turnover.\n\nIn Series 2, Jodie has to go to Portugal in a hurry, leaving Hope to hold the fort. So the arrival of Hope's cousin Maria, from Dagenham is a bonus, until she starts bringing her southern ideas to a northern makeover, and her advice to Hope's relationship with ex-husband Gavin.\n\nJodie's husband Dave is none too pleased with the makeover either, but comes round when Hope and Maria agree to look after his Mam while he plumbs in toilets in Goole.\n\nOther characters include passionate roadmender Ray, triumphant divorcee and anxious would-be poet Jenny, posh restaurant reviewer Anita and Hope's moody teenage daughter Carrie.\n\n\nCast:\nNicola Duffett\nDebra Stephenson, \nSuranne Jones, \nSusan Cookson, \nNeil Dudgeon, \nElizabeth Godber, \nRalph Brown, \nShaun Prendergast, \nBen Crowe, \nJoanne Frogatt, \nAnne Reid\n\n\n\nWriters:\nJohn Godber, Jane Thornton\n\n\nSpread A Little Happiness - S01 - E01 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S01 - E02 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S01 - E03 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S01 - E04 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S01 - E05 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S01 - E06\n \nSpread A Little Happiness - S02 - E01 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S02 - E02 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S02 - E03 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S02 - E04 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S02 - E05 \nSpread A Little Happiness - S02 - E06 \n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3d60c7a4c33018e155de93fed3fb85f959d5ea","amp;dn":"Spread+A+Little+Happiness+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3d60c7a4c33018e155de93fed3fb85f959d5ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,61,96,199,164,195,48,24,225,85,222,147,254,211,251,133,249,89,213,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
