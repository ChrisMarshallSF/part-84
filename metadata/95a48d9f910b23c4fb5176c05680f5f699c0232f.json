These files may be lost by emptying the Recycle Bin or using other deletion actions that bypass the Recycle Bin altogether. Such actions include WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Shift-Delete, command line deletion, deleting excessively large files or using applications that delete files without the Recycle Bin.\nWhen a file is deleted from the Recycle Bin, or if the recycle bin is bypassed altogether, the file can no longer be recovered by the WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Operating System. However, the content of the file still remains on the drive, relatively intact, until the section of the drive it occupies is overwritten by another file.\n\nFile Recover identifies the contents of these lost files on the hard drive and allows you to recover them. If a file has been partially overwritten, File Recover attempts to reconstruct as much of the file as possible with the remaining contents. This allows you to salvage at least part, if not all, of that recovered file to continue using it as required.\n\nFile Recover feature highlights\n\nRecovers files instantly from hard drives, floppy drives and other types of fixed media. If you are a home user or a network administrator, File Recover fills a critical gap in your data protection strategy.\n\nRapid scan engine - a typical hard drive can be scanned for recoverable files within minutes.\n\nScan all files and directories on selected hard drives.\n\nSearch for a file to be recovered by using part or all of its file name.\n\nUtilizing a non-destructive, read-only file recovery approach, File Recover will not write or make changes to the section of the drive from which it is recovering data.\n\nHas the ability for batch file recovery (recovers multiple files in one action).\n\nWorks around bad-sector disk areas. Recovers data where other programs fail.\n\nSupports standard IDE/ATA/SCSI hard drives, including drives larger than 8 GB.\n\nSupports hard drives formatted with WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS file systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a48d9f910b23c4fb5176c05680f5f699c0232f","amp;dn":"%7E%7EPc.Tools.File.Remover+v8+WITH+KEYGEN%21%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a48d9f910b23c4fb5176c05680f5f699c0232f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,164,141,159,145,11,35,196,251,81,118,192,86,128,245,246,153,192,35,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
