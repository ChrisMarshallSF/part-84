Matt's been having an affair with Ann Merai Harrison, a woman who's separated from her husband Chris and who says that she has cancer. When her doctor tells her of a new treatment that's expensive, Matt gives her the nearly half a million dollars that he seized from some drug dealers. When she turns up dead evidence points to Whitlock. He tries to figure out what's going on but apparently it appears he's been set up. So he has to try and find the money especially now that the Feds are asking for it before the evidence exposes him.\n\nCast:\n\nDenzel Washington...Matt Lee Whitlock\nEva Mendes...Alex Diaz Whitlock\nSanaa Lathan...Ann Merai Harrison\nDean Cain...Chris Harrison\nJohn Billingsley...Chae\nRobert Baker...Tony Dalton\nAlex Carter...Cabot\nAntoni Corone...Deputy Baste\nTerry Loughlin...Agent Stark\nNora Dunn...Dr. Donovan \n\nVideo Format:\n\nFORMAT:MPEG-4\nFILE SIZE:699 MiB\nDURATION:1h 45mn\nWIDTH: 1280 pixels\nHEIGHT:528 pixels\nASPECT RATIO:2.40:1\nFRAME RATE:23.976 fps\nVIDEO BITRATE:860 Kbps\nLANGUAGE: English \n\n\nAudio Format:\n\nFORMAT: AAC\nFormat/Info:: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version: Version 4\nFormat profile: LC\nCodec ID: 40\nDuration:1h 45mn\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nChannel positions: Front: L R\nBit rate:64.0 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage: English\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/7804/38390449.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/7804/38390449.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/4264/76802283.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/4264/76802283.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/5812/28212661.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/5812/28212661.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/img171/424/26200942.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img171.imageshack.us/img171/424/26200942.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n:::::::::::::::::Enjoy Another Release of Simba!:::::::::::::::::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5faf4b76794f9646ed891cc32ed85346f6fbb8e4","amp;dn":"Out+of+Time-2003-BRRip-720p-H.264-%7BSimba%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5faf4b76794f9646ed891cc32ed85346f6fbb8e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,175,75,118,121,79,150,70,237,137,28,195,46,216,83,70,246,251,184,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
