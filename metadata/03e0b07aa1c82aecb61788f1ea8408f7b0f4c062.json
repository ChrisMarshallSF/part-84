His music experience started in Greenville, MS sitting in with various local musicians like Willie Foster, John Horton, T-Model Ford, and Eddie Cusic who would all tell him, &quot;you ain't no good, but yoou have a good ear and you don't mess us up. Come back next week.&quot; After three years of woodshedding and bartending in the Delta he moved to Oxford, MS where he formed his first band, Three Legged Dog which featured traditional, old-school country blues played at break neck speed with a full four piece band. After touring the southeast and living in many different places Jay ended up back in Oxfrod, Ms ready to start fresh with a new band and a new sound, Jay Lang and the Devil's Due. The formula is simple: electric slide guitar with a heavy backbeat and super-bad guitar leads.\n\n01. Come On In\n02. Love Me Leave Me\n03. Gimme Back My Money\n04. Bang Bang\n05.
