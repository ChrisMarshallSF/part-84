They stay in the home of the wealthy Barata family, whom they met while on vacation. The Baratas believe that Anastacio and his family are also from the upper class, a situation which is complicated when the Barata's son Eduardo falls in love with Anastacio's daughter Juju. The two decide to marry in Lisbon, forcing Anastacio to maintain the charade, at no small financial expense.\n\n\n&quot;Having explored the contrast of classes - O Costa do Castelo (1943) - and the cult of the microphone - A Menina da RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡dio (1944) -, Arthur Duarte addressed, in his third comedy of success, which converge on the same authors, technical and artists, the phenomenon of football: that is The Lion of the Star - recreating the classic rivalry between Sporting Clube de Portugal and Futebol Clube do Porto, although the motivations of the film irradiated, so subtle, in the traditional sociological contrast between North and South\n\nAreas where little fanciful highlights the trend of the clan Lisbon - particularly a hilarious, by the contrivance of situations and the whims of fate. The values of nobility and the rich display of gifts is beyond appearances, private or cosmopolitan, of virtue and vice scintillator between obscure rules. For this, nothing better than two sensational players - the histrionic Antonio Silva, the screaming Erico Braga. The filmic version - a commercial success in debut - removed the satirical aspects of the original piece of theater. &quot;Instituto CamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµes\n\n   General\n      Complete name : O Leao da estrela.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.35 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 51mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 730 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 1 528 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 448 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.393\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.219\n      Stream size : 1.19 GiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 153 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039563/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039563/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPortuguese audio: English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subpack\n\nArthur Duarte - O Leao da Estrela [The Lion of The Star] (1947)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f8841349b84b0f4402be1da19d7edef6989f16","amp;dn":"Arthur+Duarte+-+O+Leao+da+Estrela+%5BThe+Lion+of+The+Star%5D+%281947%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f8841349b84b0f4402be1da19d7edef6989f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,248,132,19,73,184,75,15,68,2,190,29,161,157,126,222,246,152,159,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
