The music is floating very well with good melodies and great harmonies. You will not easy find a comparable album of that kind. It\\'s pleasing and interesting at the same time.\nOne negative point is the production style. Do not play this album very loud - headaches are bound to occur: The nice female vocals (Megan Wheatley) are excessively midtone-emphasized and so are some (not all) instruments. Believe me, there is nothing wrong with your amplifier or headphones.\n\nmore infos at:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adequacy.net/2010/10/all-over-everywhere-inner-firmament-decay/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adequacy.net/2010/10/all-over-everywhere-inner-firmament-decay/&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=5803&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=5803&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=70839&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=70839&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdfe8664b0fb63e7c595274d240c42abd08093ab","amp;dn":"All+Over+Everywhere+-+2010+-+Inner+Firmaments+Decay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdfe8664b0fb63e7c595274d240c42abd08093ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,254,134,100,176,251,99,231,197,149,39,77,36,12,66,171,208,128,147,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
