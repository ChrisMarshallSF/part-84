However if such a film is made badly it can be particularly bad. Fortunately American History X, which deals with the story of two Neo-Nazi brothers as one questions his convictions, is an exceptional film. A film on this topic was never going to be trivial but whilst some scenes are excruciating to watch, it is nonetheless compelling. This film makes a strong statement about the futility of racism and intolerance in general without the message getting in the way of the story at any point.\n\nThe realism of the portrayals due to brilliant acting in the lead roles means that whilst you may loath the characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attitudes and opinions you realize that they are people not just stereotypes. Rather than seeing these young white kids as hideous fascists, you realize that they are more of a lost generation desperately seeking an identity in all the wrong places. They are the victims of exploitation as much as they are the promoters of intolerance.\n\nThis is the film that cemented Ed Norton as a superb leading actor after a string of excellent supporting roles and the underrated Edward Furlong also sensitively portrays his character in a very difficult role, leaving you with an unsettling mix of sympathy and abhorrence. There are a number of films on the same theme such as Romper Stomper and Made in Britain but American History X is the standout example of the group. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to believe that there are really people like this in the world and if any other film told me so I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe it. American History X however is exceptional. \n\nMedia Info:\neneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\American History X (1998)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\American History X (1998)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.52 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 831 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nBit rate                         : 1 498 Kbps\nWidth                            : 718 pixels\nHeight                           : 472 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.184\nStream size                      : 1.24 GiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 272 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 335 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5665\n\n2/3/2011 1:13:26 AM\nmbam-log-2011-02-03 (01-13-26).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 45 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
