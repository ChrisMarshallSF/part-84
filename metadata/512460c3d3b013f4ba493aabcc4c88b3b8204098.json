The fires killed  173 people; destroyed over  2,000\n        homes  and  incinerated  swathes  of  prime  forest  and   its\n        wildlife.  Fires,  though,  are a  natural  process  and these\n        mountain forests need fire to regenerate.\n\n        Severe bushfires occur  here at least  every 70 years  and all\n        the  complexity  of a  mountain  ash forest  takes  up to  two\n        hundred years  to recover.  Even in  the face  of overwhelming\n        devastation,  plants  and  animals have  an  uncanny  knack of\n        bouncing back, and  the environment an  extraordinary capacity\n        for healing.  Told in  beautiful cinematography,  this is  the\n        story of how Nature rises out of the ashes.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                This is not the same as the release by UNVEiL\n\n               UNVEiL URL http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1691334/\n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:512460c3d3b013f4ba493aabcc4c88b3b8204098","amp;dn":"Out.Of.The.Ashes.2010.READ.NFO.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"512460c3d3b013f4ba493aabcc4c88b3b8204098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,36,96,195,211,176,19,244,186,73,58,171,204,76,136,179,184,32,64,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
