It is one of a dying breed, a place with real soul and stacked with piles of vinyl where the slogan is &quot;If we don't have it - them don't mek it.&quot; It's owned by the charismatic, irrepressible Rudy Sharpe (Larrington Walker), who is reluctantly helped out by his long-suffering neurotic son Adam (Lenny Henry). \n\nAdam has been forced to move home after a divorce and a nervous breakdown. Having left behind his life in London, he finds himself trapped in the confines of his father's dusty old record shop, sharing the miniscule flat upstairs with his dad and his 17-year-old son Richie, who is a constant source of worry for Adam. \n\nWhile Rudy and Richie get on like a house on fire, bonding over music and chasing the ladies, Adam is the odd one out - a classical music fan trapped in a world of funk and soul. With Rudy's approach to filing - &quot;If it ain't on the shelf, it's on the floor&quot; - clashing with Adam's post-breakdown need for calm and order, the shop is a constant battleground as both men want to run things the way they think it should be done, leaving Richie and work-shy shop assistant Tasha to keep the peace. \n\nA tale of three people forced into finding a way to survive each other's company on a day-to-day basis, Rudy's Rare Records celebrates an old man, one in the midst of a mid-life crisis and a young man, bickering, snickering, breaking up and making up - all day, every day. \n\n\nEpisode details &gt; http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/rudys_rare_records/episodes/ \n\n\nCast: \nAdam ......
