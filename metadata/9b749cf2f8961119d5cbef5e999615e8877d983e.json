Written by Smokey Robinson, its got a lovely looping beat, great lyrics &amp; a catchy chorus. Really a perfect pop record though not really in the 60s style Motown became famous for.\n\nAlso from the 60s is perhaps the least known track on the album &quot;Festival Time&quot;; in truth not a great track, perhaps the weakest on the album but quite rhythmic.\n\nWe get 2 excellentmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ post Diana Ross Supreme's hits &quot;Automatically Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Floy Joy&quot; both written by Smokey &amp; both fair sized hits, being up tempo 'happy' sounding tracks.\n\nIn a similar vein is their collaboration with the Four Tops on &quot;Love In Your Heart&quot;\n\nOther standout tracks include &quot;Superstar&quot; from the Temptations, which really motors, &quot;Surrender&quot; by you know who and &quot;If You Really Love Me&quot; by Stevie Wonder.\n\nMany will enjoy the 'teeny bop' pop of Michael Jackson but for me the best track by a mile is &quot;Walk In The Night&quot;\n\nHere we get Jnr. Walker's sax at its most mellow, over a sweet soul sounding girl backing group; catchy song with great swirling strings &amp; sax that has just enough guts when it counts - absolutely fabulous and nothing like any other Motown hit I can think of!\n\nWorth buying the album for although there are plenty of Jnr. Walker albums out on CD to choose from.\n\nOverall a great album, featuring some great stars, with a very clean sound on all tracks even those from the 60s.\n\n1.
