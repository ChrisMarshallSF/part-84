Thrasher's harmonica (who is an excellent harmonica player) has more space on this album too. Album contain several songs whose familiar titles mislead you into expecting familiar lyrics.\n\n\nproper blues...good as it gets...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:954763c1c79159c5acba7f7036b1bf89b2008dfb","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Robert+Lowery+-+Rainin%5C%27+Down+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"954763c1c79159c5acba7f7036b1bf89b2008dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,71,99,193,199,145,89,197,172,186,127,112,54,177,191,137,178,0,141,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
