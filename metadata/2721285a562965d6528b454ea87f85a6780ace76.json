Download\n2. Use WinRAR or your favorite unpacking program\n3. Extract the file\n4. Run Dead Space\n5. Run the trainer.\n\n\nNOTE: The trainer will mention a .DLL when you start it up. This is because I made it on TMK which requires a .DLL. You do not need to download it, nor will it inject it.\n\nTHERE ARE NO VIRUSES CONTAINED IN THIS TORRENT.\n\nIf you complain about AVG picking it up as a virus, get a better AV such as MBAM.\n\nOk? Enjoy.\n\nIf you like the torrent, comment so that others may see it and enjoy it for themselves!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2721285a562965d6528b454ea87f85a6780ace76","amp;dn":"Dead+Space+Trainer+v+1.0.0.222+-+%5BSil3nt+Pr0digy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2721285a562965d6528b454ea87f85a6780ace76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,33,40,90,86,41,101,214,82,139,69,78,168,127,133,166,120,10,206,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
