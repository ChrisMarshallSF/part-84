Released on August 20, 2008 by Roadrunner Records, the album was published in two versions: the standard album in a Compact Disc case and a special edition packaged in a six-fold digipak containing three bonus tracks, a 40 page booklet, and a bonus DVD with a documentary of the album's recording. Preparation for the album began in 2007, while recording started in February 2008 in the band's home state of Iowa. All Hope Is Gone is Slipknot's first studio album since 2004's Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). Before the album's launch, Slipknot released a series of promotional images and audio samples from the album through various websites. All Hope Is Gone is considered the band's most eclectic-sounding album, incorporating elements from their previous three. All Hope Is Gone includes their &quot;brutal&quot; edge, such as the track &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot;, reminiscent of songs such as &quot;(sic)&quot; from their debut self-titled album; slow burning, &quot;trippy&quot; elements such as &quot;Gehenna&quot;, reminiscent of &quot;Skin Ticket&quot; from their second album Iowa; and acoustics (&quot;Snuff&quot;) and guitar solos (&quot;Psychosocial&quot;), which were first introduced on Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses).\n\nTracklisting:\n.\t&quot;.execute.&quot;  \t                1:48\n2.\t&quot;Gematria (The Killing Name)&quot;  \t6:01\n3.\t&quot;Sulfur&quot;  \t                4:37\n4.\t&quot;Psychosocial&quot;  \t        4:43\n5.\t&quot;Dead Memories&quot;  \t        4:28\n6.\t&quot;Vendetta&quot;  \t                5:15\n7.\t&quot;Butcher's Hook&quot;  \t        4:14\n8.\t&quot;Gehenna&quot;  \t                6:53\n9.\t&quot;This Cold Black&quot;  \t        4:40\n10.\t&quot;Wherein Lies Continue&quot;  \t5:36\n11.\t&quot;Snuff&quot;  \t                4:36\n12.\t&quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot;  \t        4:45\n\nTotal length:                           57:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:059ff884d031d236edaa0092b8aa73b26c19cacd","amp;dn":"Slipknot-All+Hope+Is+Gone+%5BCD+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"059ff884d031d236edaa0092b8aa73b26c19cacd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,159,248,132,208,49,210,54,237,170,0,146,184,170,115,178,108,25,202,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
