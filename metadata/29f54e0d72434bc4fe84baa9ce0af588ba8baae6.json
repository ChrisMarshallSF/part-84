(-:\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Smokey\\\\\\&quot;(Gem)--Man!!, I still love this slinky-sexy-funky\njoint here! With the late great Glenn Goins and his distinct\nchurchified tenor ranting, raving, and extolling the joys of\nloving a double-entendre, which could be perceived as either\na woman or some bomb-azz weed! (-:\nI love Bernie \\\\\\&quot;Da Vinci\\\\\\&quot; Worrell\\\\\\'s keyboard and synth work\non this, along with both Glenn &amp; Garry Shider\\\\\\'s tasty rhythm\nguitar feels woven in between.\nI also love the droned background vocals of Garry, Fuzzy,\nGrady, Ray, Calvin, George and Mudbone from Bootsy\\\\\\'s Rubberband.\nThe \\\\\\&quot;lookin\\\\\\' back at cheaww!\\\\\\&quot; and the \\\\\\&quot;Waell, weall, weall, weaaaaawwwwlll!!\\\\\\&quot;\nLike Al Green and Sly Stone on acid!\nIn black gospel singing, these are known as \\\\\\&quot;squawls\\\\\\&quot; or\ndrawling out a word by changing the pronunciation from you\nto yeaww, and so forth.\nI just love the atmosphere of this jam and it\\\\\\'s eerie\nbuild up to the end.\n\n\\\\\\&quot;If You Got Funk, You Got Style\\\\\\&quot; (Semi-Gem)\nWas a throw away track from Bootsy\\\\\\'s Rubberband\\\\\\'s debut\nalbum sessions. George &amp; The Gang tried to salvage it,\nbut it still sounds like just a pretty good demo with\nsome good potential. It\\\\\\'s cool.\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Hardcore Jollies\\\\\\&quot;(Semi-Gem)--Is just basically\nMike \\\\\\&quot;Kidd Funkadelic\\\\\\&quot; Hampton working out on his mighty\naxe, along with the other musicians in an impromptu jam session.\nIt just shows that a funk band can play rock after all!\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Soul Kiss\\\\\\&quot; is a real gem to me!--Quirky, catchy, hooky,\nGeorge Clinton\\\\\\'s writing style is flirtatious and lewd at\nthe same time without being vulgar. The vocals and the\ntrack all work well together, and I always wished this\ncould\\\\\\'ve been a B-Side to another stronger song.\nReal P-Funk Headz know and love this one!\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Cosmic Slop (Live)\\\\\\&quot;(Gem!!)--Recorded live in the upstate\nN.Y. Air Force Hangar during the P-Funk Earth Tour rehearsals,\nI really love this stripped down, raw, and slightly sped-up\nversion of their original 1973 hit, which has it\\\\\\'s charm as well,\nbut I like this one more for it\\\\\\'s energy.\nThe sound crew must\\\\\\'ve been buzzing, because the backgrounds\nare pulled down too low in the mix on the\n\\\\\\&quot;Would you like to dance with me, we\\\\\\'re doing the Cosmic Slop!\\\\\\&quot; part.\nIt was sung really lazy, like what you would hear in a\nrehearsal, but it still works fine.\nThe guitar between Mike, Garry and Glenn is stellar!\nThis song still rocks!\n\n\\\\\\&quot;You Scared The Lovin\\\\\\' Outta Me\\\\\\&quot; (Gem!!)--Everything about\nthis song is the bomb!!--The atmosphere, the guitar-layered\ntrack, Jerome \\\\\\&quot;Bigfoot\\\\\\&quot; Brailey\\\\\\'s kickin\\\\\\' drumming, and of course..\nthis is a Glenn Goins vocal tour de force!\nYou really hear the uniqueness of his very soulful vocal\ninstrument on this song!--Another true P-Funk Headz staple!\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Adolescent Funk\\\\\\&quot; (Semi-Gem)--Sounds like they just had\na very laid back track for a demo they were working on\nand George just told Bernie to stretch out on it and play with it.\nThen the little scatted vocal line just kind of developed.\nIt\\\\\\'s cute, but more demo than a song.\nIt closes the album out though on a mild note.\n\nOverall I gave this album a 4 star rating...\nit\\\\\\'s not one Funkadelic\\\\\\'s best, but it has some great gems on it.\nStill worth a good listen after 33 yrs. \n\nMore of what you\\\\\\'re funkin\\\\\\' for in .flac.\n\nMp3 is AM radio compared to Flac.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f54e0d72434bc4fe84baa9ce0af588ba8baae6","amp;dn":"Funkadelic+-+Hardcore+Jollies+.flac+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f54e0d72434bc4fe84baa9ce0af588ba8baae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,245,78,13,114,67,75,196,254,132,186,169,206,10,245,136,186,139,170,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
