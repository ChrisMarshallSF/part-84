The results were a surprise to all, and not about to go unpunished. The contestants were woken at an unsociable 5am for a gruelling training session, after which they were given their bio ages by resident Doctor Swan. Each family member then recorded a video message to their future selves. That night the contestants were presented with their first Contest, endurance: a three-round, 10km race on the treadmills. Jodie, Leigh, Joe and Jarrod were chosen as the contesting champions, with The Blacks and Whites left at the final round.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45761cfd297924629975fc5cec59880fa7c776ea","amp;dn":"Biggest-Loser-Australia-S06E03.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45761cfd297924629975fc5cec59880fa7c776ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,118,28,253,41,121,36,98,153,117,252,92,236,89,136,15,167,199,118,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
