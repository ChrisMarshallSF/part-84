Ole, Fredrik, Jonas, Dan (first bass-player) and Marcus started the band via shattered previous music-constellations. ETB was born. \nWith the first ever self-entitled, self-released EP (2005), including first versions of songs such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWithout YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œObsoleteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, things took a good start. ETB got out to play a bunch of local shows and after a while some of the major summer-festivals in Sweden got in touch and got the band over to play. In 2006 the band decided to create another EP. Time turns fast when you put all youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got in to it and the 2nd EP was written. 2nd bassist BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn a.k.a. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBJÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ replaced Dan just before the scheduled studio-time. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll chase the ache awayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2007) included the hit-song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFalling DownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and got the band a managament-deal. Bad Taste Records signed the band up and the band somehow got real. The musical climate in Sweden at the time was a bit restricted. ETB got their fair share of good gigs, but they felt that a change of surroundings was desperately needed. Moving collectively to GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶teborg, Sweden took things a step further. \nMonths flew by and the band got in the studio to record their first full-length. BJ got out, current bass-man Nils Holm joined in. The album, which was totally self-financed, was an album built on chance and hope. ETB took a leap, without a record-deal. Fortunately, Howling Bull Records (Japan) had their eyes open for ETB and signed the band to release their debut-album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe PhantomimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \nThe two yet un-official EPs was melted down to one, the official release; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Mime EPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. It was released worldwide in 2009, digitally, via Itunes. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Mime EpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ contains the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMicrophobiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, opening track of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe PhantomimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The band has never been more exited, energetic and hungry. ETBs debut-album is released on January 13th 2010 in Japan. Rest of the world? Just you wait.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n01. Microphobia\n02.
