Miranda, a mother of three, says she feels like a walking volcano. She admits to screaming and yelling at her young daughters and belittling them on a daily basis. Even her husband, Socorro, says he's afraid of Miranda's wrath and feels powerless to stop her. What's at the root of MirandaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fury, and can she get a handle on her temper? Then, Arlana and Damon say they're fed up with their 9-year-old son, Davontae's, aggressive behavior. They say he curses at them, kicks holes in the wall and attacks his older brother. Arlana says she worries for the safety of her other three children, and she's ready to leave Davontae with his father. Why is the boy so riled up? The couple points fingers at each other, but learn what Dr. Phil says is the real issue.
