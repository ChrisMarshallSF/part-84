The \ndramatic &quot;Cambodia&quot;? The firmly tongue-in-cheek &quot;Love Blonde&quot;? Her American no. 1 \nhit single &quot;You keep me hangin' on&quot; ? The beautiful ballad &quot;Four letter word&quot;? \nThey're all here, together with a selection of the other, lesser known singles. \n\nAll of them are worth listening to again and again... and again... \n__________\n\n 1.
