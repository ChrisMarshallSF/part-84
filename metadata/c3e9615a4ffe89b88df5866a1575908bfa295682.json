Down In Flames\n\n\n\nWho knows PRO-PAIN, knows that you could describe their style without any problems as Metalcore. Who knows me, knows that you can normally drive me out of a room with such sounds, but still there is something that makes PRO-PAIN (along with STUCK MOJO) the only band of this style that even I like...\n\nThis band combines Hardcore with real powerful Metal, with much aggression, but also those necessary melodies, which accentuate the force of the sound, thus giving it even more power in comparison. The opener &quot;Fed Up&quot; shows this in an impressive way, because the verses come over fast and aggressive before a super-heavy, double-bass-driven chorus unleashes the Metal-hammer on your ears, great start!\n\nAlso in the course of the whole album PRO-PAIN master the walk on the razor's edge between aggression and accessibility successfully, &quot;Status Quo&quot; and &quot;Psywar&quot; should be mentioned as further feature songs.\n\nSo also Metalians, who normally have a natural allergy against Hardcore and its influences should at least check out PRO-PAIN, you might get positively infected...
