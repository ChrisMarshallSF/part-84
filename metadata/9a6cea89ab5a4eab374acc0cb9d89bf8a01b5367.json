Convert your Blu-ray files in AVI in one click. Select the audio and subtitle of your choice from the video, and press convert.  You may burn the conversion to DVD if you would like. Conversions are completed quickly, giving you the best quality possible. Create an AVI in stardard or high definition format: 720 or 1080 pixels in the output size of your choice.  Your AVI files can be uploaded to the internet or played by various plays that support the AVI format (one of the most widely supported formats besides DVDvideo - vob files).

The live preview allows you to watch the conversion process. \nWith the VSO burning engine included in the software, burn your project onto DVD automatically. \n\nFeatures\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Convert Blu-ray videos to AVI\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Top imageand fast conversion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Easy file selection\n\nOther Features\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Convert Blu-ray videos to AVI in an easy 1, 2, 3 step process: \n1) Select the Blu-ray video and choose the audio and subtitle track\n2) Use the quality analyzer to adjust settings for the best quality \n3) Just sit back and relax during the conversion!

Whether you want to convert a movie or a Blu-ray series, the discrimintor presents the main files you need and insures the correct ordering of the files. This means no more sorting through long lists of video files wondering which file is the right one to select - our software does it all for you. Not only that, but for films with multiple angles, a special preview module helps you choose which angle you want to convert.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Extra Fast\nOur software has been optimized for multi-core processors meaning you get even faster conversions. Speed up your conversions by using the Cuda profile which will use NVIDIA CUDA technology during the decoding/encoding process. Now convert 3x's faster and you can even use your computer as you normally would without being slowed down by the conversion as your GPU is processing the data instead of your CPU!\n\nSupported Formats\n\nInput format\n\nVideo:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Blu-ray disc from optical drive\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Blu-ray Folder from hard drive\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Blu-ray ISO image file\n\nOutput format \n\nVideo:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ AVI format \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Standard definition\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Standard definition\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ HD Ready 720p\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full HD 1080p\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ User defined output size\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Output can be split over mulitple disks\n\nAudio:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ depends on the source and the profile selected for the conversion, \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ for a low resolution output is stereo \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ for other profiles it can be up to 6 channels\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ output can contain mutliple audio tracks\n\nSubtitle:\nadded to the video file (incrusted in video)\n\nDisks:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DVD +/- R\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DVD +/- RW\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DVD +/- DL\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nHardware:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Processor Intel Pentium III / AMD Athlon \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ (Intel Pentium 4 / AMD Athlon XP or equivalent recommended)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 512 MB RAM with Windows XP \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1 GB RAM with Windows Vista\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Hard disk drive with at least 4.3 Gbytes free\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Blu-ray reader/optical drive\n\nOperating System:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista, Windows 7\n\nExtra tools:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A blu-ray decrypter such as AnyDVD is needed if converting from a blu-ray disk.\t\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Install The Software.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Copy The Crack File To The Software's Directory.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Done.
