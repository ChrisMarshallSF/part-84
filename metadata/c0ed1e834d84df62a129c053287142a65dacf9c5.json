Still shocked by\n                Coburn's revelation, Joe insists that he must come\n                clean before someone else does it for him. A chance\n                encounter with drug user Angie makes Coburn reassess\n                his attitude to street crime, and he realises that\n                many of the community's problems have the same root:\n                Jake Little. Judge Coburn and Father Jim finally\n                start to talk about the past, and Coburn makes a\n                shocking discovery. A stand-off between Sharna and\n                Jake Little reveals some surprising news.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                First release was out of sync.\n\n                The rules for naming releases don't state what to do\n                when there are two series that are from the same\n                country and also the same year.
