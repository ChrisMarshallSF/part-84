In an unprecedented display of popular protest, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators are gathering in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Mansoura, Sharqiya and elsewhere. Intense confrontations are taking place with state security forces. The protests come amid a vast security clampdown. Earlier, the government blocked the Internet, mobile phone and SMS services, with the hope of disrupting demonstration planning. We go to Cairo to speak Ahmad Shokr, an editor at the Egyptian daily newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm.\n\n\n- Juan Cole: &quot;Egypt is a Praetorian Regime&quot;\n\nHundreds of thousands of taken to the streets across Egypt today in the fourth day of unprecedented protests against the 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak. We speak with University of Michigan Professor of History Juan Cole. &quot;The last 30 years, the Arab world has seen a series of Arab nationalist regimes relatively secular, which have become increasingly sclerotic,&quot; Cole says.\n\n\n- Global Call To Release Imprisoned Indian Rights Activist Dr. Binayak Sen\n\nAn Indian high court is hearing arguments to release the nation's most famous political prisoner on bail and suspend his conviction. Last month, a trial court sentenced renowned physician and rights activist Dr. Binayak Sen to rigorous life imprisonment on the basis of an archaic colonial-era sedition law. Dr. Sen, along with two others, were found guilty of sedition and criminal conspiracy by a court in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on allegations of helping a banned group of Maoists. On Sunday, Dr. Sen's supporters around the world will mark a global day of protest against his conviction. Democracy Now!'s Anjali Kamat traveled to Chhatisgarh and filed this report on what lies behind the targeting and conviction of Dr. Sen.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71cd1d212a9e8e2a5cda9afb9dc0bf6866eb3d51","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+28+jan+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71cd1d212a9e8e2a5cda9afb9dc0bf6866eb3d51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,205,29,33,42,158,142,42,92,218,154,251,157,192,191,104,102,235,61,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
