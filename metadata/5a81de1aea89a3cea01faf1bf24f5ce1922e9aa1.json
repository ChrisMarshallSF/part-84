I use emdebian to upgrade (in squeeze) and make the iso smaller.  I have now tried to include the linuxmint live-installer and although the dependencies installed the deb itself is in /usr/local/bin/ and I would appreciate any comments on how to successfully install it.  Smxi, sgfxi, gparted and inxi are installed.  I hope this works for lots of you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a81de1aea89a3cea01faf1bf24f5ce1922e9aa1","amp;dn":"debian-live-6.0.0-i686-openbox-installer.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a81de1aea89a3cea01faf1bf24f5ce1922e9aa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,129,222,26,234,137,163,206,160,31,175,27,242,79,92,225,146,46,154,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
