The album zooms with renewed vigor, well placed cameos, and Zevon's trademark mix of black humor and heartache. Things kick off with the chugging title track, highlighted by a stinging solo from fellow iconoclast Neil Young. Zevon then turns his chronicler's eye towards the boxing ring with the gripping &quot;Boom Boom Mancini.&quot;\n\nFrom there it's Springsteen territory &quot;Working at the Factory&quot; with Bob Dylan supplying the harmonica breaks. R.E.M. turns up on the jaunty &quot;Even the Dog Can Shake Hands,&quot; which takes passing pot shots at hanger's on. Never one to wallow in self-pity, Zevon turns his forked tongue inward on &quot;Detox Mansion.&quot; His alcohol rehab experiences bubble over the top in the alternately hilarious and gripping song, resulting in the album's funniest, hardest hitting and ultimately, most rewarding moment.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nWarren Zevon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar, bass guitar, guitar, piano, keyboards, vocals\nBill Berry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nPeter Buck ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nJorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar, vocals\nMike Campbell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar on &quot;Reconsider Me&quot;\nDarius ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sitar on &quot;Bad Karma&quot;\nBob Dylan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica on &quot;The Factory&quot;\nAmp Fiddler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards on &quot;Leave My Monkey Alone&quot;\nFlea ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar on &quot;Leave My Monkey Alone&quot;\nDon Henley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, harmony on &quot;Trouble Waiting to Happen&quot;\nDeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar on &quot;Leave My Monkey Alone&quot;\nCraig Krampf ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums on &quot;Reconsider Me&quot;\nTony Levin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar on &quot;Reconsider Me&quot;\nDavid Lindley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone, violin, lap steel guitar\nStan Lynch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, harmony on &quot;Bad Karma&quot;\nMike Mills ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\nRick Richards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar on &quot;Even a Dog Can Shake Hands&quot;\nBrian Setzer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar on &quot;Trouble Waiting to Happen&quot;\nLeland Sklar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar on &quot;The Heartache&quot;\nMichael Stipe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, harmony on &quot;Bad Karma&quot;\nWaddy Wachtel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar, vocals\nJennifer Warnes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, harmony on &quot;The Heartache&quot;\nJai Winding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards on &quot;Reconsider Me&quot;\nKai Winding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\nNeil Young ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar on &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n2.&quot;Boom Boom Mancini&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n3.&quot;The Factory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n4.&quot;Trouble Waiting to Happen&quot; (J.
