L.B.S. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Live @ Time Warp 2011 (Mannheim, Germany) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 02-04-2011\n\n\nThe who's who of electronic music, the state-of-the-art in video, lighting and laser technology, a magnet for techno fans from all over the world - all of this is Time Warp in Mannheim. But Time Warp is much more than just the pure combination of music and technology. It is also a joyous come-together of the international techno scene and represents a fixed meeting place for the Time Warp community that has been formed across national borders with one thing in common: an immeasurable great love for electronic music.\n\nIt is a very strong feeling of solidarity that connects Time Warp so strongly with its audience, therefore turning this normal event into an annual mandatory one in which fans are already looking forward to it months in advance. And this is for a reason. Both musically and technically, Time Warp sets new standards again and again. Unforgettable past performances have been the reincarnation of Richie Hawtin's &quot;Plastikman&quot; in 2010, the collective sit-down during Reboots &quot;Caminando,ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ the legendary 2008 closing, and the birth of the cult slogan &quot;Gude mood Aldaaaaa&quot;?\n\nIn 1994 we saw the launch of the first Time Warp. Back then it was held at a location called ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“WalzmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hleÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ in Ludwigshafen with a young DJ named Sven VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤th. Finding itself in the middle of an emerging techno movement in Germany, Time Warp had enormous appeal with the party people there, although the experiences back then didnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t by far come close to the one of today. But along with the European techno scene, Time Warp has steadily grown and the space at the WalzmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hle was no longer sufficient to accommodate the Time Warp event. After being held at a few spots in-between, the Time Warp was held at the Maimarkthalle in Mannheim in 2000, where it is still at home today!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff07a07207d9d75c23fbf5330e5fcf9ad4c6ef4e","amp;dn":"TIME+WARP+FESTIVAL+presents+LIVE+-+Laurent+Garnier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff07a07207d9d75c23fbf5330e5fcf9ad4c6ef4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,7,160,114,7,217,215,92,35,251,245,51,14,95,207,154,212,198,239,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
