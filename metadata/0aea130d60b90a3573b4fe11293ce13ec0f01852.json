On this album, we get to see the influences first hand, and I can only wish that they still made songs like this. There are some good songs here that only casual Stones fans wont know, but they are missing some great music. I think that the listener should give these following songs a real listen to: NOT FADE AWAY, ROUTE 66, I JUST WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU, HONEST I DO, CAN I GET A WITNESS, LITTLE BY LITTLE, I'M A KING BEE. These songs are great and fun to listen to. With the bonus of being remastered, I think compared to the earlier CD, you can hear a difference. I highly recommend this CD for every STONES fan, and this isnt a bad place for some casual fans to start. \n\nby Martin Lemos\n\n01 - Not Fade Away.wma                                                          \n02 - (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66.wma                                           \n03 - I Just Want To Make Love To You.wma                                        \n04 - Honest I Do.wma                                                            \n05 - Now I've Got A Witness (Like Uncle Phil And Uncle Gene).wma                \n06 - Little By Little.wma                                                       \n07 - I'm A King Bee.wma                                                         \n08 - Carol.wma                                                                  \n09 - Tell Me (You're Coming Back).wma                                           \n10 - Can I Get A Witness.wma                                                    \n11 - You Can Make It If You Try.wma                                             \n12 - Walking The Dog.wma   \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\n\nFollow Me On Facebook Pages: Marcelodrgz (The Pirate Bay)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aea130d60b90a3573b4fe11293ce13ec0f01852","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+England%5C%27s+Newest+Hit+Makers+%281964%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aea130d60b90a3573b4fe11293ce13ec0f01852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,234,19,13,96,185,10,53,115,180,254,17,41,60,225,62,192,240,24,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
