These songs were recorded at various gigs around Australia on cassette and then thrown into a box in a corner to gather dust. This bloke named Ian Marshall came along and painstakingly went through them &amp; pulled out songs &amp; arranged them on a CD for release in Brasil where we have a strong fan base. Without Ian, all this live Aussie musical history would be lost forever because the box is still in the corner where the Spys left it. Many thanks, Ian Marshall.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:155a35e49e7fd76b8e5608c93d4b33a6676d515a","amp;dn":"vSpy+vSpy+Demolition+The+Hottest+Place+in+Town","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"155a35e49e7fd76b8e5608c93d4b33a6676d515a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,90,53,228,158,127,215,107,142,86,8,201,61,75,51,166,103,109,81,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
