Besides various instrumentals, it includes three dedicated &quot;nail'd&quot; songs: &quot;Count for Something&quot;, &quot;Through Walls of Flame&quot; (sung by Jamey Jasta), and &quot;Decimator&quot; (vocals by Wayne Static). All lyrics were specially written for the game. \nIn addition, licensed tracks from Slipknot, Queens of the Stone Age, Backyard Babies, Rise Against, American Sixgun, Aggressive Chill, and Slaves on Dope help turn on the heat in nail'd even more.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNote from me:\n\nThis torrent only includes 2 songs, I didn't see these posted anywhere else, there in 128kbps mp3 format. I'm to lazy to download and install this game. Maybe someone will be nice enough to upload there games audio folder so we can all enjoy these songs in Higher quailty.\n\nTracklist:\n\n  Jamey Jasta - Count For Something\n  Wayne Static Feat Jamey Jasta - Cockroach\n\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b2fa4a1c2e1433ba683075efe8e42cf18c8ec20","amp;dn":"Nail%5C%27d++Game+OST+%282+Tracks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b2fa4a1c2e1433ba683075efe8e42cf18c8ec20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,47,164,161,194,225,67,59,166,131,7,94,254,142,66,207,24,200,236,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
