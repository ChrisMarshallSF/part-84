Here's a torrent I made myself of &quot;The Darkness&quot; for the XBox 360.\n\nI had previously played and enjoyed &quot;The Darkness&quot; on the PS3, and when I saw a copy of the 360 version for five bucks, I figured I'd buy it and rip it.\n\nWhen I ripped the disc I had bought, abgx360 said it was region-free, so figured it would be a good candidate to upload!\n\nSo, here is a region-free English copy of &quot;The Darkness&quot; for the 360.  It's an old game, but I enjoyed playing through it and figured it's always nice to pick up oldies but goodies.\n\nArchive is 7-zipped, tested a burn with imgburn on my modded 360 and it works just fine.  Again, abgx360 says it's region-free, but I purchased the game in Amerika so I'm using it on my modded NTSC Amerikan XBox 360 just fine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a6526812c1b83ee02e6f667206d1f7875c983a5","amp;dn":"%5BXBOX+360%5D+The+Darkness+%28360%29+RF-NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a6526812c1b83ee02e6f667206d1f7875c983a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,101,38,129,44,27,131,238,2,230,246,103,32,109,31,120,117,201,131,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
