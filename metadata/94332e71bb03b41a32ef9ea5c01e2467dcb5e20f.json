The film offers a revealing glimpse of the\n      human characters behind the judgments and explores why the\n      Supreme Court and its members are fundamental to our democracy.\n      The 11 men and one woman who make up the UK Supreme Court have\n      the last say on the most controversial and difficult cases in\n      the land. What they decide binds every citizen. But are their\n      rulings always fair, do their feelings ever get in the way of\n      their judgments and are they always right? In the first 14\n      months of the court they have ruled on MPs' expenses, which led\n      to David Chaytor's prosecution, changed the status of\n      pre-nuptial agreements and battled with the government over\n      control orders and the Human Rights Act. They explain what\n      happens when they cannot agree and there is a divided judgment,\n      and how they avoid letting their personal feelings effect their\n      interpretation of the law. And they face up to the difficult\n      issue of diversity; there is only one woman on the court, and\n      she is the only Justice who went to a non-fee-paying school.\n      Sandel goes in search of Jeremy Bentham, Immanuel Kant and\n      Aristotle, three philosophers whose ideas inform much\n      contemporary thinking on justice, and tests their theories\n      against a range of contemporary problems. Filmed in Berlin,\n      Boston, Athens and London, this thought-provoking film includes\n      interviews with the world's great philosophers, modern-day\n      politicians and thinkers from all around the globe.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
