We all agreed it was superior to the 109F and completely outclassed our Spitfire Vs. It was not until some months later that our intelligence admitted the introduction of a completely new fighter, the redoubtable Focke-Wulf 190, designed by Kurth Tank.&quot; - Group Captain, 'Johnnie' Johnson, RAF Fighter Ace, writing of his first encounter with the Fw-190 in 1941\nThis amazing package from the renowned 'Classics Hangar' development team, includes key variants of this incredible warbird - from early A-3 and A-4 models to the monster 2,200hp A-9. The final version of what many say was the finest piston aircraft to ever take to the skies.\nFive highly detailed FSX-native interior and exterior models are included, featuring 21 historical exterior liveries in high resolution - supporting bloom, specular bump-mapping and self shadowing.\nAll are individually simulated to award-winning quality and re-create German micro-mechanics in remarkable detail. Classics Hanagar's &quot;1%&quot; flight modelling data means you too can feel what it was like to fly one of the most feared aircraft in WWII - to a level not yet seen in flight simulation.\n\nContains:\n\n1. setup.exe\n   28 July 2010 - Updated with patch to correct Pilot insignia\n\n2.
