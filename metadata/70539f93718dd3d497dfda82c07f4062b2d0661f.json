Devastating earthquakes and tidal waves will completely destroy civilization as Europe and North America are pulled north to polar latitudes. Almost all the earth's population will perish. These predictions stem from the sophisticated astronomy of the Maya and Egyptians, descendants of the legendary original Atlanteans, whose island, in this theory, is now buried under the South Pole. The Atlanteans predicted the world-wide flood in 9792 BC. In 2012, according to several 10,000 year-old star codes, Venus, Orion and several other stars will take the same 'code-positions' as in 9792 BC. There is also a forgotten and massive labyrinth, created by the Old Egyptians, of secret chambers filled with artifacts and documents about the previous flood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70539f93718dd3d497dfda82c07f4062b2d0661f","amp;dn":"The+Orion+Prophecy+-+Patrick+Geryl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70539f93718dd3d497dfda82c07f4062b2d0661f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,83,159,147,113,141,211,212,151,223,218,130,192,127,64,98,178,208,102,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
