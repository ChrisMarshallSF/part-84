It was destroyed by the malevolent Decepticon leader Megatron in his quest to get hold of the All Spark. The Autobots want to find the All Spark so they can use it to rebuild Cybertron and end the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, while the Decepticons want to use it to obliterate the Autobots and take over the universe. Megatron had managed to locate the All Spark on Earth,but crash-landed in the Arctic Circle and froze in the ice. After stumbling upon his frozen body in 1897, explorer Captain Archibald Witwicky accidentally activated Megatron's navigational system and his eye glasses were imprinted with the coordinates of the All Spark's location, an incident that left him blind and mentally unstable. Sector 7, a secret government organization created by President Herbert Hoover, discovered the All Spark in the Colorado River and built the Hoover Dam around it to mask its energy emissions. The still-frozen Megatron was moved into this facility and was used to advance human technology through reverse engineering.\n\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\n\nShia LaBeouf\nMegan Fox\nJohn Turturro\nJosh Duhamel\nTyrese Gibson\nPeter Cullen\nHugo Weaving\nMark Ryan\n\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1276.59 MiB\nDuration: 2h 16mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 303 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-19 09:08:52\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 2 channels\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz\n\nscreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32356437051895288744.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32356437051895288744.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96072869937987755227.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/96072869937987755227.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32356437051895288744.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32356437051895288744.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStoryline: Thousands of years ago, there was a race of ancient Transformers who scoured the universe looking for energon sources. Known as the Dynasty of the\nPrimes, they used machines called Sun Harvesters to drain stars of their energy in order to convert it to energon and power Cybertron's All Spark. The Primes agreed that life-bearing worlds would be spared, but in 17,000 BC, one Prime, thereafter dubbed &quot;The Fallen&quot;, constructed a Sun Harvester on Earth. The remaining Primes sacrificed their bodies in order to hide the Matrix of Leadership ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the key that activates the Sun Harvester ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from The Fallen, who swore to seek revenge upon Earth.\n\nIMDB Link:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055369/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055369/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\n\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1272.54 MiB\nDuration: 2h 29mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 187 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-20 05:19:38\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 2 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nscreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/48351394490618004212.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/48351394490618004212.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63889015480096520049.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63889015480096520049.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/55245783080262595283.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/55245783080262595283.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWe are searching for good encoders.Contact us if you wish to be in our gang!\nIf you like our encodes,keep them alive!
