I enjoyed this 1st episode of the new series\n and think it looks promising enough to deserve  converting to hardsubbed avi and presenting \nfor general release for everyone that shares my dislike of mkv format.\n========================\n\nAll credit for Fansubs goes to Fnolli,\nty for the hard work.\n I look forward to more installments to re encode :)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n.hack//Quantum is an OVA series, part of the .hack conglomerate.\n The series will consist of three episodes and is being presented by Bandai Visual company. \nAnimation is produced by Kinema Citrus (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0) with director Masaki Tachibana \n(Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Noir) taking charge of the animation. .hack// writer Tatsuya Hamazaki \nis writing the OVAs and video game and anime composer Ko Otani (Shadow of the Colossus, \nBlade of the Immortal) is composing the music for the series.
