I will STRONGLY suggest for personal use only and to never post new porn threads on /vp/ with this material or any porn in general. This was designed to lower the number of porn threads by finally giving everyone all the porn they would ever need or find. It solves most of the problem right then and there.\n\nYou may copy and paste links into threads to end them. There's no need to clog up the front page. Alternatevely, you can just paste this link.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rs.4chan.org/?s=Gary+Oak&amp;from=ALL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rs.4chan.org/?s=Gary+Oak&amp;from=ALL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHell, you can even just look up &quot;Gary Oak&quot; on /rs/ and the same links will appear, and you can copy the address into threads.\n\n---\nIntroduction\n\nThe Pokeporn Archive was made by me to combat all the porn threads and garybombing that was going on many moons ago. I was tired of seeing tits and sex (suprising I know, but it's possible to get sick of looking at porn), and gary spam everywhere all days of the week. So one day I decided to make this to fight back indirectly and non-agressively. It works because it pretty much holds all the pokeporn a person would ever need and more, so it removes the necessity of threads. Posting the  links around helps because then it gives it to more people who would then stop posting. Garybombing  never worked because it's 4chan and people do things out of spite, or anger.\n\nNow, I know that people want to fap, and I honestly don't give a shit if you post porn on /vp/. But you should all remember. Porn is fine in moderation (One thread at a time, and spoilered), but when you get to the levels of 8 threads a day all over the damn place, then you know you have a problem with the board. And honestly, I know it is incredibly hypocritical for me to make threads ABOUT porn when I even say that I don't want it all over /vp/. But hey, what works right?\n\n---\nFAQ\n\nQ: Why is there no M+M gay?\nA: Still a WIP. Just wait for v2.0. I'll delay the release until it's finished.\n\nQ: I bet you have something against gay people, huh.\nA: No, I don't care if you're gay. Everything offensive I do is all a joke when regarding the matter.Deal with it fags, welcome to 4chan.\n\nQ: Something is in the wrong place!\nA: Sorry about that, I have tried to organize them, but the sheer number of them prevents me from actually going through all of them. I've tried to sort them a bit better, but you can't expect all too much when there's thousands of pictures.\n\nHow to help me if you see a problem with locations.\n1. Find the name\n2. Email me or post in one of my threads the names/ID # tags\neg. Misc Pokemon47, or Ivy8, 9, and 10.\n3. I'll be able to find it and easily search and destroy (Or, just move it), for the next update.\n4. Thanks for helping!\n\nQ: So there's a lot of tentacles, but no visible pokemon in the PokemonxHuman sections. What gives?\nA: Since there's so many pokemon that DO have tentacles, and how some of them match, I'd rather play it safe than sorry and move ALL tentacle porn, whether it has a pokemon in it or not, to the PokemonXHuman section since I really don't know. If you have a better solution, I'd be happy to hear it. I've also moved egg porn to it as well.\n\nQ: Why is there so much shit in this?\nA: I've made an attempt to get rid of all the REALLY bad art. You can have your own opinions on it\nbut if you hate it so badly, why not just delete it yourself? Perhaps you can send me a suggestion?\n\nQ: When do you make threads?\nA: Never daily, around 5PM EST. I make them as I please, this is just a reference for general times.\n\nQ: Why is there a lot of X pokemon/character compared to Y pokemon/character?\nA: Some pokemon/characters just don't have that much porn. Sorry bro.\n\nQ: I keep posting but I sometimes accidentially forget to spoiler? wat do?\nA: First, don't panic. click the check mark next to your post and scroll down and press delete. You will have to wait a few seconds before you are allowed to delete your post. I don't take it too seriously, but try and avoid posting without spoilers as it might get unwanted attention.\n\nQ: Will there be a new thread after the first one hits image limit?\nA: Depends. If there's a lot of people who say yes, I'll go for it. If there happens to be a large amount of spam, then no. I'd rather not go through the trouble.\n\nQ: Why isn't there a new archive yet? It's already been a few weeks.\nA: Because I'm incredibly busy. And I don't want to stare at porn all day sometimes.\n\nQ: Why is there Renamon in the Archive?\nA: It's a joke, and Renamon is always related.\n\nQ: Can I have some of your real contact info?\nA: NOPE! Other than what I listed above, I'm not going to have random anons interfere with my personal life. If you want to find out more about me, don't bother. The emails, twitter, and anything else is unrelated to me. Besides, it's more than enough to contact me.\n\nQ: What's your waifu?\nA: Blaziken. If you have some new porn of her that'd be great!\n\nQ: Gary? Posting porn?\nA: Yes, it's called irony.\n\nQ: What can I do to help?\nA: Spoiler all your porn, don't spam, be polite, and if there's a conversation, you \nare welcome to join.\n---\nUseful Tools\n\nVisipics: The most used tool in my arsenal, it finds and sorts similar pictures for deletion.\nLink: http://www.visipics.info/index.php?title=Download\n\nBulk Renamer: Renames files and folders en masse.\nLink: http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php\n\n/b/rowser: A neat tool that allows you to browse a whole board.
