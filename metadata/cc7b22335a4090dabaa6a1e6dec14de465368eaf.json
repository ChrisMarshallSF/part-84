Which required people moving and finding new jobs and homes. In mid 2009 Tom was added to the fold to fill a desire for a fuller guitar sound. Shortly thereafter Mockingbird embarked on its first recording venture and DIY tour. Mockingbird currently has a S/T Ep/CD released on Innervenus records. Produced by Phillip Cope and recorded by Jay Matheson at The Jam room studios in Columbia, SC. \n\nMockingbird has done this all at a DIY level with help from few. Much of the Mockingbird ethic has evolved from the indepedent H/C punk scene of the 80's and 90's and the personal necessity to create and break from the chains and illusions that confine our limited everyday senses. And the desperate need for a sense of communication beyond words. The CD is currently being pressed on Vinyl and a split 7&quot; with Ohio's Red Sun is also due to be released near March of 2011. Mockingbird is currently working on new material after a fun Summer tour and ass load of shows.\nMembers of Mockingbird have been in other such bands as: Rune, Temple of Set, Rue, Ichabod Crane, 23rd Chapter and way to many more....\n\nCurrent lineup\nAndy Strickland - Guitar\nMike Faucher - Bass\nChadd Beverlin - Drums\n\n****My personal rip****\n\nGenre = Sludge / Post Metal\nFormat = mp3\nBitrate = 320 kbps\nFile Size = 45.43 MB\n\nTracklist\n1.
