Spent more than 20 hours remastering a nice clean 24bit, 96K file from original vinyl.  There is some LF hum which is actually on the orginal album, which I suspect is feedback from the bass direct box because when the bass player goes to electric bass is subsides.  It is much better than other copies by far so I really hope you enjoy this album!  Praise TPB because Columbia Records didn't release this on cd unless they could sell a million copies and there are only a limited amount of vinyl left around, so at least we can all enjoy the performance once more!\nPlease seed and leave comments!  Still working on other albums as well.\n\nRickster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa0e1b9202f04bc05530fe31c91c5b46b660d7a","amp;dn":"MF+Horn+4+%26+5+Live+At+Jimmy%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa0e1b9202f04bc05530fe31c91c5b46b660d7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,160,225,185,32,47,4,188,5,83,15,227,28,145,197,180,107,102,13,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
