Zoe Mulford's first album since moving to England draws on the spirit of the British folk clubs and features musicians from both sides of the Atlantic. The mix of original and traditional songs (plus one cover) presents a cast of wayward ghosts, takers of chances, and practitioners of love against the odds\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/28/zoe-mulford/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2e2f65679752b260ea58aaa1f100025e2f3d78","amp;dn":"Zoe+Mulford...Bonfires%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2e2f65679752b260ea58aaa1f100025e2f3d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,46,47,101,103,151,82,178,96,234,88,170,161,241,0,2,94,47,61,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
