Rihanna)\n[Rihanna]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie\n\n[Eminem]\nI can't tell you what it really is\nI can only tell you what it feels like\nAnd right now it's a still night in my wind pipe\nI can't breathe but I still fight while can fight\nAs long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight\nHigh off the law, drunk from my hate,\nIt's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate\nAnd right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me\nShe fucking hates me and I love it.\nWait! Where you going? I'm leaving you\nNo you ain't. Come back we're running right back.\nHere we go again\nIt's so insane cus when its going good its going great.\nI'm superman with the wind at his back\nShes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap\nWho's that dude? I don't even know his name\nI laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again\nI guess I don't know my own strength\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Eminem]\nYou ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe\nWhen you're with 'em\nYou meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em\nGot that warm fuzzy feeling\nYeah, them those chills you used to get 'em\nNow you're getting fucking sick of looking at him\nYou swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him\nNow you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them\nYou push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him\nThrow him down pin him\nSo lost in the moments when you're in them\nIt's a race that's the culprit controls your boat\nSo they say you're best to go your separate ways\nGuess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday\nYesterday is over it's a different day\nSound like broken records playing over but you promised her\nNext time you show restraint\nYou don't get another chance\nLife is no Nintendo game\nBut you lied again\nNow you get to watch her leave out the window\nI guess that's why they call it window pane\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Eminem]\nNow I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean\nAnd we fall back into the same patterns same routine\nBut your temper's just as bad as mine is\nYou're the same as me\nBut when it comes to love you're just as blinded\nBaby, please come back\nIt wasn't you, baby it was me\nMaybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk\nI told you this is my fault\nLook me in the eye ball\nNext time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall\nNext time. There won't be no next time\nI apologize even though I know its lies\nI'm tired of the games I just want her back\nI know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fucking leave again\nIm'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire\n\n[Chorus]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c79965d5f1ef9b3fd85f303831b8e435d3845e","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+Love+The+Way+You+Lie+-+Recovery%282010%29+-+HD+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6c79965d5f1ef9b3fd85f303831b8e435d3845e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,199,153,101,213,241,239,155,63,216,95,48,56,49,184,228,53,211,132,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
