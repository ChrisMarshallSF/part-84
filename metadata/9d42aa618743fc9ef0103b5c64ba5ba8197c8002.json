Unbeknownst to the neighbors, hidden beneath this home is a vast secret hideout. Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru, planning the biggest heist in the history of the world. He is going to steal the moon. (Yes, the moon!) Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world\\'s greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubtitles\n\nEnglish\nNederlands\t\t\t(Dutch)\nEspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\t\t\t\t(Spanish)\nFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais\t\t\t(French)\nSveska \t\t\t\t(Swedish)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo\n\nFormat\t\t\t\t: AVCHD\nRuntime\t\t\t\t: 1:34:48\nCodec\t\t\t\t: x264\nWidth\t\t\t\t: 1280 Pixels\nHeight\t\t\t\t: 696 Pixels (720p including the black bars)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAudio\n\nCodec\t\t\t\t: DTS\nBit Rate\t\t\t: 1536 Kb/s\nChannels(s)\t\t\t: 6 Channels\nChannel Positions\t\t: 3 Front 2 Rear/LFE\nAudio Sample\t\t\t: 48.0 KHz\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow to Play:\n\nwhen playing on a AVCHD compatible Blu-Ray player or playstation 3.\n\n\tDownload and install http://www.imgburn.com/, this is a program for\n\tburning files on a DVD.\n\tNow insert a blank DVDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±R or a DVDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±RW, make sure the importand files\n\ton you Rewriteable are back-upped.\n\tDubbelclick te .mds image file so it opens ImgBurn, then set the\n\tWrite Speed in the settings to 4X.\n\tNow start the burning process by clicking the image to disc icon.\n\tWhen the program says you need to erase the disc before write it,\n\tclick Yes.\n\n\tWhen everything is done you can insert the disc in your AVCHD\n\tcompaiable Blu-Ray player or Playstation 3 and play the movie.\n\tSubtitles can be changed by pressing the subtitle button on your \n\tremote or when playing on your Playstation 3 by pressing the triangle\n\tbutton, select the subtitles options and press X untill your luangage\n\tis displayed.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen playing on a computer with AVCHD compatible software like PowerDVD 10.\n\n\tWhen you want to play your movie from a DVD follow the steps in the\n\ttutorial above for playing on a AVCHD compitable Player.\n\n\tif you want to play your movie in a virtual optical drive like \n\tDaemon tools mount the .mds file in your program, not the .iso cause\n\tit won\\'t play your movie and will say that your drive is incapable.\n\n\tPlay the the disc, when the \\&quot;what to do\\&quot; screen apears, with your\n\tAVCHD compatible software.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHaving questions about files or how to play them, you can always ask them by\nmail.
