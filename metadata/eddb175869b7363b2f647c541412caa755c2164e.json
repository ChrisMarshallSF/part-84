However, their father isn't a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like ghosts, vampires, and various demons and he's trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They eventually find their father, who reveals that the creature that killed Sam and Dean's mother years earlier is a yellow-eyed demon and the only thing that can kill him is a legendary gun created by Samuel Colt.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eddb175869b7363b2f647c541412caa755c2164e","amp;dn":"Supernatural+Season+1%5BDvDRip%5D%5BChris%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eddb175869b7363b2f647c541412caa755c2164e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,219,23,88,105,183,54,59,47,100,124,84,20,18,202,167,85,194,22,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
