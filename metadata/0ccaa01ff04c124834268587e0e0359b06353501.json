Decked out in an unbecoming blonde wig, Jane is cast as Hollywood starlet Laurel Stevens. On the eve of her latest picture,&quot;The Kidnapped Bride&quot;, Laurel is kidnapped for real by Runyonesque crooks Mike (Ralph Meeker) and Dandy (Keenan Wynn). She assumes it's a publicity stunt staged by her studio, but soon figures out what's what. When the kidnappers fall for Laurel and decide to set her free, she insists that they go through with their ransom demands, lest she be accused of faking the abduction for publicity purposes. Based on a much funnier novel by Sylvia Tate, The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown was an enormous flop which not even the combined comic expertise of supporting players Fred Clark, Una Merkel and Benay Venuta could salvage. Thanks to constant TV showings in the 1960s, however, the film finally posted a profit. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050422/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050422/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:24:26\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1025 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 134 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ccaa01ff04c124834268587e0e0359b06353501","amp;dn":"The+Fuzzy+Pink+Nightgown+%281957%29+Eng%2CSpanhardsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ccaa01ff04c124834268587e0e0359b06353501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,202,160,31,240,76,18,72,52,38,133,135,224,224,53,155,6,53,53,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
