The female vocals courtesy of Ms. Kjer are prominent, but there are also a lot of male vocals weaving into the songs. Instrumentation is sparse and delicate and is mostly composed of two acoustic guitars. Although the jazzy beginnings may lead you to believe there is a mainstream approach, staying with this record reveals a vibrant and delicate folk to psychedelic-folk approach not unlike Elly &amp; Rikkert or the Balladeers. It is more subtle here, but the songs are quite beautiful and are successful in transplanting me to a dreamy, contemplative state of mind. Some nice electric slide touches add to the atmosphere. There are even a few songs with full band accompaniment that add some rock and jazz touches at times. This one goes on my short list for repeated listenings. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/28/lonnie-kjer-stefan-m%c3%b8rk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/28/lonnie-kjer-stefan-m%c3%b8rk/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:337c621ac6debe1f5427f20f5950bd52bb6ee746","amp;dn":"Lonnie+Kjer+%26+Stefan+M%C3%83%C2%B8rk...13+songs%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"337c621ac6debe1f5427f20f5950bd52bb6ee746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,124,98,26,198,222,190,31,84,39,242,15,89,80,189,82,187,110,231,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
