A beleaguered church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights to transport an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight\\'s pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force.\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c914b4d3e1368b34189ede81a258493407998d0","amp;dn":"Season+of+the+Witch+2011+DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c914b4d3e1368b34189ede81a258493407998d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,145,75,77,62,19,104,179,65,137,237,232,26,37,132,147,64,121,152,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
