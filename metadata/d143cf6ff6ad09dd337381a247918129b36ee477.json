The songs are his, true, and he is the \n\nvoice, but each person involved added his or her own touch, always to the \n\nbetterment of the music. On the whole, these are ensemble pieces and \n\nProfessor Dick Neal and Marc Douglas gathered the best of the best to lay \n\nthem down. No big names here, or at least names you might recognize away \n\nfrom the East Coast, but man, they can play. And they do.\n\nTake the bi-polar So, Regarding Me and You with its early Steely Dan \n\nsoundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a dirge with attitude which allows Liam Bailey to show why a \n\nresonator guitar resonates, his fingers making no less magic than those of Jeff \n\nBaxter for Steely Dan. Add the string arrangement (and strings) of Larry \n\nDeming and you have one of the many highlights of Harbor.\n\nNo less so than Working, which leans more toward the mid-Steely Dan \n\nsound, rock and light jazz combining for that soft but rocking feel. The story \n\nof a musician finding his way, it could very well be the life story of Marc \n\nDouglas Berardo the Musician, a testament to what music and performing \n\nmeans to him personally. The CTI-sounding acoustic guitar toward the end is \n\nan especially nice touch, reminding one of the wonder days of George Benson \n\nand Phil Upchurch in the seventies.\n\nAnd if you want personal, Marc Douglas delivers that as well. Indeed, it is at \n\nhis most personal that he excels. The album is peppered with excellent \n\nreflective songs, not the least of which is Harbor. Light plucked acoustic guitar \n\nand voice create a sort of morning dream, quiet and floating, until the strings \n\n(Larry Deming again) and the secluded french horn of Susan Spaulding carry \n\nBerardo to the end. This is a way of life, Berardo says, for me and for many \n\nbefore me. This song tells us why we love the Coast so much, simple as that.\n\nPerhaps Where the Road Turns to Shell and Sand tells us why and how \n\nBerardo got to where he is. From Madison Avenue to jack of all trades at the \n\ndocks is a huge step, backwards by today's skewed standards, but he would not \n\nbe the first one to throw away money and success for inner peace. This is an \n\nexplanation in tone poem, supported by strings and french horn in an \n\norchestral splendor of sorts. Hollywood could make a movie based on this \n\nsong alone (and if they did it right, it would be a damn good one).\n\nWhile most of us hate abuse, Berardo feels it more than most. Abuse is a cry \n\nagainst abusers, especially those who target children, and if it wasn't a damn \n\nfine song it would be worth hearing for message alone. &quot;And the sins of the \n\nmother and the father,&quot; he sings, &quot;Are passed on to the daughter and the son, \n\nAnd the words that abuse live forever, deep inside the little one.&quot; A beautiful \n\nsong with a message we should revisit often.\n\nIn the liner notes, Professor Dick Neal gives thanks to Marc Douglas &quot;for \n\ninviting me to collaborate on this project and then bringing superb material, \n\nideas and performances.&quot; From a musician as accomplished as Neal, this is \n\nhigh praise. A few listens to Harbor might have you wondering if the praise is \n\nhigh enough. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/10/marc-douglas-berardo-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/10/marc-douglas-berardo-2/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d143cf6ff6ad09dd337381a247918129b36ee477","amp;dn":"Marc+Douglas+Berardo...Harbor%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d143cf6ff6ad09dd337381a247918129b36ee477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,67,207,111,246,173,9,221,51,115,129,162,71,145,129,41,179,110,228,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
