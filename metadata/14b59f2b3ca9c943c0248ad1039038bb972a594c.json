The third album Somewhere Over The Radio saw a greater emphasis on their distinctive brand of jangly pop/rock spawning two singles &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; and &quot;Deeper Water&quot; (their biggest hit, reaching #28 on the Australian ARIAnet Singles Chart[1]) bringing the band some success in Australia in 1999.\n\nThe band enjoyed mixed success during its lifetime. They had some success in the UK and toured there after extensive radio play of single Sex Sell. Always Triple J favourites and in later days finding themselves on high rotation on the commercial radio stations, and with their music being used in television and film productions, they were a perhaps a promise that was never fully realised.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b59f2b3ca9c943c0248ad1039038bb972a594c","amp;dn":"Deadstar+-+Milk+%5B1996%5D+%5BAutralian+Band%5D+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b59f2b3ca9c943c0248ad1039038bb972a594c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,181,159,43,60,169,201,67,192,36,138,209,3,144,56,187,151,42,89,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
